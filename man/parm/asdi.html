     ASDI

     ASDI is the ending valid time for ASDI data, the mode of the display,
     the time increments (in minutes going back from the ending time) and
     the corresponding colors for the ASDI data.

	End time|Mode|DepArr|( time increments/colors or height ranges/colors)|
            time limit|SITES

     The ending time is the latest time for which the ASDI data will be 
     plotted.  The end time is given as a GEMPAK date/time string.

     Where Mode can be set to "T" for time, "H" for height.
     Where DepArr can be set to "D" for Departure, "A" for Arrival, "B"
      for both.  Default = "D".
     
     If the Mode is "T", the time increments and colors may each be specified
     using either a list separated by semicolons or a range in the form 
     first-last-increment. Time increments are given in minutes going back
     sequentially from the ending time.  The number of time increments must be 
     the same as the number of colors.  If no time increment and color are 
     given, a single time increment of 5 minutes with a default color of red 
     will be used. If the range format is used for the time, an increment must
     be specified. If the range format is used for the color and an increment
     is not specified, an increment of one is used.
     
     If the Mode is "H" for height, the height range and colors may each be 
     specified using a list separated by semicolons. Height ranges are in
     hundreds of feet, separated by a "dash". The number of height ranges
     must be the same as the number of colors.  Plotting is up to the time
     limit specified in minutes.
     
     If SITES is specified, it may be specified as ALL, or a combination of
     individual 3-letter site IDs separated by a ";". Valid site IDs are MCI,
     ATL, ORD, LAX, DFW, PHX, DEN, LAS, IAH, MSP, DTW, JFK, SFO, EWR, MIA,
     MCO, SEA, PHL, CLT, BOS, LGA, BWI, SLC, FLL, IAD, MDW, TPA, SAN, DCA,
     MEM.  The default is to plot ALL sites.
     
     Examples:


	ASDI  = 120501/0000|T|B|5;10;20;30/2;17;5;3

 		ASDI data for 120501/2355 to 120501/0000 will be plotted
 		in red; for 2350 to 2354 in orange; for 2340 to 2349 in yellow;
 		and for 2130 to 2340 in green.
        
        ASDI =  120501/0000|H|B|050;100;150;200;250;300;350;400;450/
                12;2;16;17;19;22;23;24;27|12
                
                ASDI data Height Representation for Heights of 0 to 45000
                feet in increment of 5000 feet, in colors of
                pink, red, dark orange, orange, yellow, green, dark green,
                navy blue, and cyan.
