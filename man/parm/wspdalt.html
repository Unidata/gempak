     WSPDALT

     WSPDALT is the ending valid time for the altimeter-derived wind
     speed data, the speed intervals and colors, and time stamp intervals
     and colors.
     Skip is a value that indicates how many rows and data points
     to skip when plotting.

       Data type | End time | Speed intervals | Speed colors |
       Skip | Time stamp interval | Time stamp color |

     The data type is a selection to plot. Currently there are three data
     types, <a href=wspda.html>WSPDA</a> (Altika), WSPDC (Cryosat), and WSPD2 (Jason-2).

     The ending time is the latest time for which the wind speed data will 
     be plotted.  The ending time is given as a GEMPAK date/time string.  Any
     missing items from the string will be filled in by the system time.  The
     ending time may also be LAST.  LAST will use the system time and plot all
     WSPDALT data for the preceding 4 hours. ALL is not accepted as an ending
     time for WPSDALT data.
