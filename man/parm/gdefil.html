     GDEFIL

     GDEFIL is the name of the grid edit file which will be used to update 
     a grid file.  The edit file must contain only complete grids.

     GDEFIL is a text file which may be created using the program GDLIST 
     with F as an output device and <a href=garea.html>GAREA</a> = DSET.  A text editor may be 
     used to create or change the grid edit file.
  
     GDEFIL must contain the following information before the complete 
     grid data:
  
     The time, level, vertical coordinate and parameter name MUST appear 
     on the same line in the order given.  The time must be a fully 
     qualified GEMPAK time.  The parameter name is the name of the grid.

     The first and last row and column information must appear on one line.  
     Column information must be preceded by the word COLUMNS:.  Row 
     information must be preceded by the word ROW:.  The first row and 
     column must be 1.  The last row and column must be the same as the 
     grid size in the file.  For example:
  
		COLUMNS:  1  8      ROWS:   1  6

     If the string FACTOR:, appears and is followed by an integer, the data 
     will be divided by 10**<a href=scale.html>SCALE</a> before being stored in the grid file.  In 
     the following example, the data will be divided by 10**5.

		<a href=scale.html>SCALE</a> FACTOR:  10**5
  
     The string <a href=column.html>COLUMN</a>: signals the beginning of the grid data.  If the 
     required grid information has not already been found, an error will 
     result.
 
     The data for the grid follows the grid keywords.  The data for a grid 
     is listed from the top (last) row to the bottom row in the grid.  
     The beginning of each row of data must be preceded by the string ROW.  
     Data consists of numeric values for each data point; missing data 
     should be entered as -9999.0.
