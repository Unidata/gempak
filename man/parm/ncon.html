     NCON

     NCON is the ending valid time for the non-convective sigmet, the colors
     for the icing, turbulence, duststorm and sandstorm, and volcanic ash,
     and flags for plotting symbols, the end time, the message id, and the 
     flight levels on the map.

     Non-convective sigmets that are valid at the ending time will be plotted
     on the map.  The ending time is given as a GEMPAK date/time string.  Any
     missing items from the string will be filled in by the system time.  The
     ending time may also be LAST or ALL.  LAST will use the system time and
     plot all current non-convective sigmets.  ALL will plot all the non-
     convective sigmets in the data files for the last ten days, whether they 
     are active, cancelled, updated or expired.

     The colors are separated by a semi-colon.  If any color is set to 0,
     that type of symbol will not be plotted.  If any color is missing, a 
     default will be used.  Defaults are green for icing, light blue for 
     turbulence, gold for duststorm and sandstorm and orange for volcanic ash.

     The symbol flag is YES or NO and controls whether or not to plot a symbol
     for the non-convective sigmet on the map.  The default is NO.

     The time flag is YES or NO and controls whether or not to plot the end
     time of the non-convective sigmet on the map.  The default is NO.

     The message id flag is YES or NO and controls whether or not to plot the
     message identification and sequence number on the map.  The default is NO.

     The flight level flag is YES or NO and controls whether or not to plot the
     flight level(s) in hundreds of feet on the map.  The default is NO.

     The Id1~10 flags are YES or NO and controls whether or not to plot the NCON
     data in corresponding names. The defaults are YES.
     The Id names are:
	 1	NOVEMBER
	 2	OSCAR
	 3	PAPA
	 4	QUEBEC
	 5	ROMEO
	 6	UNIFORM
	 7	VICTOR
	 8	WHISKEY
	 9	XRAY
	10	YANKEE
