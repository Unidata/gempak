     HRCN

     HRCN is the ending valid time for the tropical disturbance, the colors for
     the hurricanes, tropical storms, tropical depressions and directional
     arrows, the symbols for the hurricanes, tropical storms and tropical
     depressions, and flags for plotting the center located time, the name and
     minimum central pressure, the speed, the wind and sea quadrant radii, and
     the forecast track on the map.

     Locations that are valid less than 24 hours before the ending time, given
     as a GEMPAK date/time string, will be plotted on the map.  Any missing
     items from the date/time string will be filled in by the system time.  The
     ending time may also be LAST or ALL.  LAST will use the system time
     and plot all current tropical weather.  ALL will plot all the tropical
     weather in the data files for the last ten days.

     The colors are separated by a semi-colon.  If any color is set to 0,
     that type of symbol will not be plotted.  If any color is missing, a
     default will be used.  Defaults are red for hurricane, yellow for
     tropical storm, green for tropical depression, and magenta for
     directional arrow.

     The symbols are separated by a semi-colon.  If they are not given,
     the default symbols will be used.  The defaults are Northern Hemisphere
     hurricane, Northern Hemisphere tropical storm and tropical depression.

     The time flag is YES or NO and controls whether or not to plot the location
     time of the tropical disturbance on the map.  The default is NO.

     The label flag is YES or NO and controls whether or not to plot the name
     of the disturbance and the minimum central pressure on the map.  The
     default is NO.

     The speed flag is YES or NO and controls whether or not to plot the
     speed in knots of the disturbance.  The default is NO.

     The quad wind flag is YES or NO and controls whether or not to plot the 64,
     50 and 34 kts wind and 12 foot seas quadrant arcs.  Only the most recent
     time period of each storm will have the arcs drawn.  The 00, 12, 24, 36, 
     48, 72, 96, 120 are decoded from the Tropical Cyclone Forecast Advisory.
     The wind ranges for all other forecast hours are assigned the value of the 
     previous decoded forecast hour.  The default is NO.

     The xx hr fcst flags are YES or NO and control whether or not to plot the
     valid forecasted latitudes and longitudes for the estimated positions at 
     the forecast time for the disturbance.  Only the most recent time period
     of each storm will have the track drawn.  The default is NO.  If both the
     quad wind flag and the xx hr fcst flag are YES, the wind and sea quadrant
     arcs will be plotted for the forecast position as well as for the most 
     recent current position.  The 00, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120 are decoded 
     from the Tropical Cyclone Forecast Advisory.  The positions for all other 
     forecast hours are obtained using a linear interpolation of the
     previous and subsequent decoded forecast hour.

     The name of a tropical storm may be specified.  If a name is declared, then
     only that storm will be displayed for the date/time indicated.  The default
     is all storms are plotted.  ALL will also plot all storms within the given
     time range.
