     WCP

     WCP is the ending valid time for the watches, the colors for the
     severe thunderstorm and tornado watches and flags for plotting
     the start and stop times and watch numbers for the watches on
     the map.

	End time|Watch colors|Time flag|Watch number flag
	    |Color code flag

     Watches that are valid at the ending time will be plotted on the map.
     The ending time is given as a GEMPAK date/time string. Any missing
     items from the string will be filled in by the system time. The
     ending time may also be LAST and ALL. LAST will use the system time
     and plot all current watches. ALL will plot all the watches in the
     data files, whether they are active, cancelled or expired.

     The colors are separated by a semi-colon.  If any color is set to 0,
     that type of line will not be plotted.  If any color is missing, a 
     default will be used.  Defaults are cyan for thunderstorm and red
     for tornado.

     The time flag is YES or NO. It controls whether or not to plot the
     start and stop times of the watch on the map. The default is NO.

     The watch number flag is YES or NO and controls whether or not to
     plot the watch number. The default is NO.
     
     If the time or number flag is YES for watch box and missing for status
     line, YES will be assigned to status line.

     The color code flag is YES or NO, if YES, the colors are associated 
     with the last digit of the watch number, otherwise, based on the
     weather type ( tornado or thunderstorm ).
