     HILO

     HILO contains the information for plotting relative highs and lows
     in the following format:

	colorh;colorl/symbolh;symboll/rangeh;rangel/radius/counth;countl/interp

     Colorh and colorl are the colors for the high and low symbols to be
     plotted.  If only a single number is entered, it will be used for
     both highs and lows.  The default for this entry is 0.

     Symbolh and symboll specify the symbols to be plotted.  The format
     for the symbol input is:
		character # precision

     where the character is the character to be plotted.  If the character
     is an integer, markers corresponding to that number will be plotted.
     If the character is an integer preceeded by the character 'S', special
     symbols corresponding to that number will be plotted.
     Information about markers can be found in the help for <a href=marker.html>MARKER</a>.  
     The # is a flag to plot values beneath the marker.  The integer following
     the # is the number of decimal places to display in the value.  If a
     # is present without the following number, integer values are printed.
     The default for the symbols is H;L.

     Rangeh and rangel are ranges for highs and lows specified as:
		minval - maxval

     where minval and maxval are integers which specify the range of values 
     to be considered for designation as a high or low.  The default is to 
     consider all data.

     The search radius is a sqaure region of grid points. The region is a
     moving search area in which all points are compared to derive relative
     extrema. The default is 3, which is generally the most effective. To
     find more concentrated areas of highs and lows, use a smaller radius.
     A large radius, such as 10 or higher, is not very effective. 

     Counth and countl are integer values for the maximum number of
     high and low values to be displayed.  The default is 20;20.

     Interp is an interpolation flag which specifies whether the values and
     locations of the highs and lows will be at grid points, or will be 
     interpolated between grid points.  The default is NO.

     In general, the above defaults are used if there is no entry for
     a part.  For the parts which have values for both relative highs
     and lows, a single entry will be used for both highs and lows.

     Examples:

	HILO = 1/H#;L#/1020-1040;980-1000/2/30;20

        Color 1 for highs and lows.
        H and L characters with numeric values plotted below.
        Plot highs from 1020 to 1040; plot lows from 980 to 1000.
        Search radius of 2.
        Plot the 30 highest highs and the 20 lowest lows in the specified
         range.


	HILO = 2;4/X#;Y#//30/yes

        Colors 2 and 4 for highs and lows.
        X and L characters with numeric values plotted below.
        Plot the 30 highest highs and 30 lowest lows.
        Locations of highs and lows interpolated between
        grid points.

	HILO = 2;4/S12#;S13#//30/yes

        Same as previous example except use special symbols 12 and 13
        for indicating relative minima and maxima.
