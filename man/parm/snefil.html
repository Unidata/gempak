     SNEFIL

     SNEFIL is the name of the sounding edit file to be used to update a 
     sounding data file.

     SNEFIL is a text file which may be created using the program SNLIST 
     with F as an output device.  A text editor may be used to create or 
     change the edit file.
  
     The parameters to be edited must be specified at the beginning of 
     the edit file.  For example:
  
		<a href=snparm.html>SNPARM</a> = PRES;TMPF;DWPF
  
     If the output sounding file exists, the data set parameters must be 
     the same as those listed in the edit file.  Station information, such 
     as latitude, longitude, and elevation, cannot be changed with SNEFIL.  
     Use GEMPAK program SNSTNS to update station information in a sounding 
     file.
 
     If the file does not exist, a new, unpacked file with these parameters 
     will be created.
     
     The data follows the parameter list.  Only level data will be added 
     to the file.  Stability indices from <a href=stndex.html>STNDEX</a> will be ignored.  The
     data should not include undecoded text (raw reports), although the
     output sounding file, if it exists, may include undecoded text.

     Stations and times which do not already exist in the surface data 
     file will be added.
