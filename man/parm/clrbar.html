     CLRBAR
 
     CLRBAR specifies the characteristics of a color bar associated with
     contour fill.  The attributes are separated by slashes:

	   color / orientation / anchor / x;y / length;width / 
		        frequency | text_info 

     Color is the color of the labels and the bounding box around the
     color bar.  If color is negative, the bounding box will not be drawn, 
     and labels will be drawn in colors corresponding to the color bar.
     If the color is 0 or missing, no color bar is drawn.
     
     Orientation specifies a vertical or horizontal orientation of the
     color bar where 'V' is a vertical bar and 'H' is a horizontal bar.
     The default is 'V'.

     Anchor describes the location on the color bar corresponding to
     the location given in the next parameter.  Valid inputs are 
     LL, LC, LR, CL, CC, CR, UL, UC, and UR for lower-left, lower-center, 
     lower-right, center-left, centered, center-right, upper-left, 
     upper-center, and upper-right, respectively.  For example, an 'LL' 
     anchor point, with a x;y of .1,.1, will place the lower-left corner 
     of the color bar at view coordinates .1, .1.  The default anchor 
     point is 'LL'.

     x;y is the position for the anchor point of the color bar in view
     coordinates.  The default is .005, .05.
     
     Length;width are the length and width of the color bar, normalized to 
     the view coordinates.  The defaults are .5 for the length, and .01 for 
     the width.
     
     Frequency describes the levels to be labeled.  If the frequency is
     positive, the labels are plotted on the right/top of the color bar.
     If it is negative, the labels are plotted on the left/bottom of the
     color bar.  The default is -1.

     Text_info describes the color bar label attributes.  These attributes
     are of the same format as the <a href=text.html>TEXT</a> parameter.  If any part of text_info 
     is missing, then default text information is used. The user may only 
     change the font type, hardware/software flag, text size and text width.  
     The default values are the bold courier hardware font and text size and 
     text width of 1.

     To disable the color bar, set CLRBAR = 0 or leave it blank.  If only
     contour lines are drawn (<a href=ctype.html>CTYPE</a> = C), the CLRBAR variable is not used.

     Examples:

         CLRBAR = 1			text and bounding box in color 1; 
					defaults for the rest of the input;

         CLRBAR = 5/V/ /.25;.1/1	text and bounding box in color 5;
					color bar plotted vertically;
					length and width .25 and .1 of the
					view window;
					all intervals labeled along left
					side of the color bar;
					color bar anchor point at lower-left;

         CLRBAR = 1//CL/.1;.5/.75;.1	text and bounding box in color 1;
					length and width .75 and .1 of the 
					view window;
					center-left of the color bar
					positioned at .1;.5 in view 
					coordinates;

         CLRBAR = 1//CL/.1;.5/.75;.1|.55/2/111/1/l/hw	

                                        text and bounding box in color 1;
					length and width .75 and .1 of the 
					view window;
					center-left of the color bar
					positioned at .1;.5 in view 
					coordinates;
                                        text size of color bar .55;
                                        hardware helvetica font; text width
                                        2; no box around text;left justified;
