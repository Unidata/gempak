     WATCH

     WATCH is the ending valid time for the watches, the colors for
     the severe thunderstorm and tornado watches and a flag for plotting
     the start and stop times for the watch on the map.

	End time|Watch colors|Watch box time flag;Status line time flag
	     |Watch box number flag;Status line number flag|Color code
	     |Most recent status line flag

     Watches that are valid at the ending time will be plotted on the map.
     The ending time is given as a GEMPAK date/time string. Any missing
     items from the string will be filled in by the system time. The
     ending time may also be LAST and ALL. LAST will use the system time
     and plot all current watches. ALL will plot all the watches in the
     data files, whether they are active, cancelled or expired.

     If a status message was issued for the watch, a line will be plotted
     dividing the expired portion of the watch from the active portion.

     The colors are separated by a semi-colon.  If any color is set to 0,
     that type of line will not be plotted.  If any color is missing, a 
     default will be used.  Defaults are cyan for thunderstorm, red for
     tornado, and yellow for status line.

     The time flag is YES or NO  for both watch box and status line. It 
     controls whether or not to plot the start and stop times of the watch 
     on the map, or the start time of the status line. The default is NO.

     The number flag is YES or NO and controls whether or not to plot
     the watch number for watch box or status line. The default is NO.
     
     If the time or number flag is YES for watch box and missing for status
     line, YES will be assigned to status line.

     The color code flag is YES or NO, if YES, the colors are associated 
     with the last digit of the watch number, otherwise, based on the
     weather type ( tornado or thunderstorm ).

     The most recent status line flag is YES or NO and controls whether 
     or not to only plot the most recent status line. The default is NO.
