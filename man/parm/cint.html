     CINT
 
     CINT is the contour interval, minimum and maximum values and number 
     of digits, separated by slashes:

		contour interval / minimum / maximum / ndigits

     The contour interval may be any real number.  If it is not specified 
     or if the value is 0, the program will select an interval which will 
     generate 5 to 10 contour levels.

     The minimum and maximum values specify the range of data to use in 
     selecting contour levels.  If either value is not specified, the 
     value will be obtained from the range of values in the dataset.  If 
     the minimum and maximum are equal, that value will be used and only 
     one contour level will be selected.

     A list of two or more contour levels may be entered using semicolons 
     to separate the individual values.  In this case, the minimum and 
     maximum are ignored.
 
     A text string may be specified to replace the contour level value as
     the contour label. In a list of contour values, enter a value and a
     text string separated by an "=" sign. The input format is shown 
     below:
                value1=label1;value2=label2;...;valueN=labelN 

     To set the contour label when plotting a single contour level by 
     setting the minimum and maximum equal, enter the value and the text
     string separated by an "=" sign before the first slash. For example:
		value1=label1 / value1 / value1

     If the number of digits (ndigits) is specified,  the integer portion
     of the contour labels is forced to contain ndigits characters, not
     counting the minus sign, if present.  If the the number of characters
     in the integer portion is less than ndigits, that portion is expanded
     by padding to the left of the leading digit with zeroes.  For example:
     if ndigits = 3 and the original label is 15 or -5, the new labels will
     be plotted as 015 and -005 respectively.  If the number of characters 
     in the original label is greater than or equal to ndigits,  the original
     label will be unchanged.  Using ndigits = 4, original labels 1260 and
     43712 would be plotted as 1260 and 43712, while a label of 580
     would be plotted as 0580.  If there are decimal places or scientific
     notation in the original labels, everything to the right of the decimal
     point will be plotted without change.  Therefore, if ndigits = 3, then
     7.25, -12.4, and 6.5E+12 would be plotted as 007.25, -012.4 and
     006.5E+12, respectively.
