     STNPLT 

     STNPLT allows the user to plot station markers and station information.

	text color / text attributes | marker attributes | stnfile # column

     Text color is the color of the station information. If the text color
     is set to 0, no station information will be plotted. Text attributes are
     text size, font, width, border, rotation, justification, and hw flag.

     Marker attributes are color, type, size, width, and hw flag. If the marker 
     color is 0, no markers will be drawn and the station information will be
     centered on the station. If the marker color is not specified, a default
     of 1 will be used.

     Stnfile is the station table from which the station information is read.

     Column refers to the station table and is the column number from which
     to get the information to display. The following shows the columns for
     a station table:
     
		1	ID
		2	Number
		3	Name
		4	State
		5	Country
		6	Latitude
		7	Longitude
		8	Elevation
		9	Priority
		10	Extra information (not always present)

     If no column number is given, the station ID will be displayed.

     Multiple files with differing colors, types, etc. may be processed 
     by listing the parameters individually separated with a '+' sign.  
     See the third example.


     Examples:

	STNPLT	= 5/1|3/12/1.25/2|sfstns.tbl

 		The text color of the station ID is color 5. The text size 1 
 		is used. The marker color is 3. The marker type is 12. The 
 		marker size is 1.25 times larger than the default size and the 
 		marker width is 2 times larger than the default width. The 
 		station table filename from which the station information is 
 		read is sfstns.tbl.

	STNPLT	= 17/1|0|snstns.tbl 

 		The text color of the station ID is color 17. The text size
 		is 1. The marker color is 0. No markers appear and the station 
 		ID will be centered on the station. Other marker values are set 
 		to the defaults.  The station table filename from which the 
 		station information is read is snstns.tbl.

	STNPLT	= 17/1|0|snstns.tbl#3

 		Same as the previous example, but displays the station name
 		instead of the ID.

	STNPLT	= 5/1|3/12/1.25/2|sfstns.tbl + 17/1|0|snstns.tbl 

 		Combine and plot the first two examples.
