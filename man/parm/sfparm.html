     SFPARM

     SFPARM is a list of surface parameters to be used in a surface 
     program.  

     The four-character parameter names must be separated by semicolons.  
     For example:

		SFPARM = TMPF;DWPF;WTHR

     If a parameter is not present in a data set, the program will 
     attempt to derive it from those parameters which are present.  
     For example, relative humidity can be computed from the temperature 
     and dewpoint temperature.  Note that STHA, STHE, and SMXR are 
     computed from PALT.
 
     In plotting programs, the position of the parameter determines
     where it will appear with respect to the station location.
     The first position is centered on the station.  The other
     positions are shown below:

		18	14	8	16	22
		19	2	10	4	23 
		12	3	1	5	13
		20	6	11	7	24
		21	15	9	17	25

     In the example above, WTHR is plotted in position 3.
  
     Functions can be used to modify/qualify the output parameters.  
     These functions must follow the parameter name and are applied in 
     the order given; however, arithmetic operators must precede the 
     other operators.  The function symbols must precede the qualifying 
     value and are defined as follows:

	*	multiply		=	equal to
	/	divide    		$	direction
	+	add      		<	less than or equal to
	-	subtract		>	greater than or equal to

     In the case of weather symbols,  the size, line width and other 
     information needed to draw the symbol may be specified following a 
     colon after the symbol name and after the function specifications 
     if any exist.  The drawing attributes are separated by colons.  For 
     all the symbols, the information is entered as:size:width;for arrows
     and barbs the information is entered as :size:width:type:headsiz, 
     where the headsiz applies only to arrows.  The type is a three-digit
     number, ABC, interpreted digit by digit as follows:

            A                       B                      C
        1 = plot calm wind   1 = start at stn        1 = not filled
        2 = ignore calm wind 2 = center at stn       2 = filled
                             3 = start on sky symbol 3 = not filled with box
                                                     4 = filled with box

     Calm winds are plotted as a circle or an arrowhead for barbs and
     arrows, respectively.  Arrowheads and 50-unit barb flags are filled
     if C=2 or 4. A box is plotted with background color if C = 3 or 4.
     For example, if <a href=type.html>TYPE</a>=132, a barb will be plotted as a circle if the 
     wind is calm; it will begin on the edge of the cloud cover symbol, 
     and 50-unit flags will be filled.  The default is 111 unless sky 
     symbols are being plotted in which case it is 131.

     The text size and line width can also be specified for plotting numerical 
     data such as temperature and dewpoint.  These follow the parameter name,
     or condition, delimited by colons.  For example, TMPF:2.5:3 , would 
     cause temperatures to be plotted with a text size of 2.5 and a 
     line width of 3.  Text sizes that are positive cause the data to be 
     plotted at the location they would appear if they were being plotted
     with the largest specified text size (ie. farther from the center of 
     the station model than they would normally appear).  Text sizes that are
     negative cause the offsets from the center of the station model to be
     computed based on the specified text size.  NOTE:  A large range of 
     negative text sizes may result in some degree of overplotting.
     When using hardware fonts, text sizes may be named sizes.  For example,
     tiny, SMALL, m, -m, -LARGE, etc, are all valid specifications.
     If no text size is provided for a particular data type, that data will
     be plotted with the default text size specified in the <a href=text.html>TEXT</a> parameter.

     For all symbols ( weather, cloud, pressure tendency, sky cover, past
     weather, icing, combination, etc. ) and wind barbs and arrows, the area
     immediately surrounding the symbol may be blanked out.  The resulting
     effect allows the object to be more easily identified.  This capability
     may be invoked by adding the additional blank-out width (*100) to the 
     object width.  For example, to blank-out an extra 8 width units
     around the weather symbols of size 2 and width 3, specify the SFPARM
     as WSYM:2:803.

     A special value of M may be used for the = function to denote a 
     missing value, so that values will be plotted only when a specific
     parameter is missing.  For example, to plot an X when the visibility
     is missing, specify SFPARM=MARK:16;VSBY=M.

     Aliases are available to make it easier for the user to plot typical
     surface data by using pre-set parameters and colors.  To use an alias, 
     enter the alias name for SFPARM and leave <a href=colors.html>COLORS</a> blank.  If the user
     does not leave <a href=colors.html>COLORS</a> blank, the selected colors will be used instead
     of the pre-set alias colors.

     See PRMLST.TBL for a list of current aliases for surface data.
