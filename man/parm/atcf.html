     ATCF

     ATCF is the initial time for the ATCF forecast tracks, the colors
     for each model track, the model names, flags for plotting the time,
     the storm name or number, the forecast wind speeds and markers at each
     forecast time, and an optional specific storm identifier.

     ATCF forecast tracks valid for the initial time will be plotted on
     the map.  Forecast tracks show points at 6 or 12 hour intervals from
     0 through 126 hours, if available.  The actual storm track will be plotted
     as a white line, solid up to the initial time and dashed after the
     initial time (when data is available).  The initial time is given as
     a GEMPAK date/time string.  Any missing items from the string will be
     filled in by the system time.  The initial time may also be LAST.
     LAST will use the system time to plot the most recent tracks whose
     initial time is within 9 hours of the current time.  ALL is not accepted
     as an initial time for ATCF data.

     The colors are separated by a semi-colon, as are the four-character model
     names.  If no colors or model names are given, all model tracks will be
     plotted at default colors.  If specific model names are listed, only those
     model tracks will be plotted.  Default colors will be used unless colors
     are explicitly given, with a one-to-one correspondence between model names
     and colors.  Specifying colors without model names has no effect.

     The time flag is YES or NO and controls whether or not to plot the initial
     time of the ATCF forecast tracks on the map.  The default is NO.

     The storm id flag is YES or NO and controls whether or not to plot the 
     storm name or number on the map.  The default is NO.

     The speed flag is YES or NO and controls whether or not to plot the 
     speed in knots, when given, at each forecast time.  The default is NO.

     The marker flag is YES or NO and controls whether or not to plot a
     marker at each forecast time on the map.  The default is NO.

     The name or number of a tropical storm may be specified.  If one is given,
     only tracks for that storm will be displayed for the date/time indicated. 
     The default is all storms are plotted.
