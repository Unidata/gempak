     SNPRMF

     SNPRMF specifies the packing formation for the sounding file to be
     created.  It may be the name of a sounding parameter packing file or
     the information itself entered as follows:

		SNPRMF = PRM1/MIN1-MAX1-RES1;PRM2/MIN2-MAX2-RES2; ...

     where each PRMi, MINi, MAXi, and RESi is the parameter name, minimum,
     maximum and resolution for a parameter to be included in the file.

     If SNPRMF specifies a file name, then each line of the file must 
     contain the following information separated by blanks or tabs:

	parameter name			CHAR*4
	minimum data value		REAL
	maximum data value		REAL
	resolution			REAL

     The resolution should be an integral power of 10; otherwise the next 
     smaller resolution will be used ( e.g., res = .5 will become .1).  

     If the data are not to be packed, the minimum and maximum data values 
     and the resolution should not be included.  Note that either all of 
     the parameters or none of them must have packing information.

     It is important to remember to include the vertical coordinate in
     the parameter packing list.

     SNMERG.PACK is a typical table used to pack sounding data.  
     This file may be used as an example when creating a packing file.

     Note that if <a href=mrgdat.html>MRGDAT</a> is NO, the data will be packed using the standard 
     packing for unmerged data, and the value of SNPRMF will be ignored.

     When SNPRMF is used with program NAMSND, the user must supply the
     parameter packing file name.  In this case, two more entries are 
     required for lines of the file, in addition to the four listed 
     above.  These entries must contain the GEMPAK names corresponding 
     to the BUFR sounding data parameters listed in the NAMSND output file 
     bufr_table.dump.  The order of the GEMPAK names must be the same as 
     the order of the BUFR parameters, although the names themselves do 
     not have to be the same.  The fifth column is the real conversion 
     factor to be applied to the GEMPAK parameter named in the sixth 
     (last) column.  Note that the last two columns of data are 
     independent of the first four, and are used only for BUFR to GEMPAK
     conversion.  The parameter named in column one does not necessarily
     have any relationship to the one referenced in columns five and six. 
     Diagnosed or extra computed parameters may be added anywhere in the
     packing file for profile data.
