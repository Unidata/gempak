     SFPRMF

     SFPRMF specifies the packing information for the surface file to be
     created.  It may be the name of a surface parameter packing file or
     the information itself entered as follows:

		SFPRMF=PRM1/MIN1-MAX1-RES1;PRM2/MIN2-MAX2-RES2; ...

     where each PRMi, MINi, MAXi, and RESi is the parameter name, minimum,
     maximum and resolution for a parameter to be included in the file.

     If SFPRMF specifies a file name, then each line of the file must 
     contain the following information separated by blanks or tabs:

	parameter name			CHAR*4
	minimum data value		REAL
	maximum data value		REAL
	resolution			REAL

     The resolution should be an integral power of 10; otherwise the next 
     smaller resolution will be used.  For example, res = .5 will become .1.

     If the data are not to be packed, the minimum and maximum data values 
     and the resolution should not be included.  Note that either all of 
     the parameters or none of them must have packing information.

     METAR.PACK is a typical table used to pack surface data.  
     This file may be used as an example when creating a packing file.

     When SFPRMF is used with program NAMSND, the user must supply the
     parameter packing file name.  In this case, a fifth entry is required 
     for each line of the file, containing a real conversion factor used  
     to scale from BUFR to GEMPAK.  Diagnosed or extra computed parameters 
     may be added at the end of the parameter list in the packing file.
     If diagnosed parameters are to be added, or if there is not enough
     room in the packing file for all the primary parameters, an 
     auxiliary packing file must be used.  This file will have the same
     name as that specified for SFPRMF, with the suffix _aux.  The
     auxiliary file is not specified explicitly in SFPRMF.  Rather, the 
     presence of the auxiliary file is indicated by suffixing the output
     surface file name given in <a href=sfoutf.html>SFOUTF</a> with a +.  Note that the order of
     the parameters in the packing file(s) must be the same as the order
     of the surface parameters listed in the NAMSND output file 
     bufr_table.dump.  The parameter names themselves do not have to be 
     the same as those in the bufr_table.dump file, but the order must be
     preserved.
