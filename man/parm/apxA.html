The following lists the GEMPAK parameter definitions with an 
example using the sample AIRWAYS cloud report: 
 
22SCT 80-BKN 250OVC  
 
Note that the character x may be replaced by L, M, or H, 
indicating low, mid or high clouds.  Also note that the
character T indicates the value of the parameter at the level
of maximum cloud coverage.
 
 
xCLD - Character cloud coverage code
       Examples: LCLD = SCT
                 MCLD = -BKN
                 HCLD = OVC
 
TCLD - xCLD at maximum cloud coverage
       Example:  TCLD = OVC
 
xCLO - Fractional cloud coverage 
       Examples: LCLO = 0.400
                 MCLO = 0.600
                 HCLO = 1.000
 
TCLO - xCLO at maximum cloud coverage
       Example:  TCLO = 1.00
 
CLCx - Numeric cloud coverage
       Examples: CLCL = 2
                 CLCM = 7
                 CLCH = 4
 
CLCT - CLCx at maximum cloud coverage
       Example:  CLCT = 4
 
 
The next two parameters combine cloud coverage values from the
three cloud levels. 
  
CLDS - Combined cloud coverage short code from three levels
       Example:  CLDS = S-BO
 
CMBC - Combined cloud coverage numeric from three levels
       Example:  CMBC = 274
 
 
The next set of parameters are combined cloud height and
cloud coverage.
      
CLHx - Cloud height in hundreds of feet
       Examples: CLHL = 22.
                 CLHM = 80.
                 CLHH = 250.
   
CLDx - Combined cloud height and short code
       Examples: CLDL = 22S
                 CLDM = 80-B
                 CLDH = 250O
 
CLDT - CLDx at maximum coverage level
       Example:  CLDT = 250O

CLDB - CLDx at the lowest ceiling/layer
       Example:  CLDB = 22S 
 
COMx - Numeric combined cloud height and coverage combined as
       CLHx * 10 + CLCx
       Examples: COML = 222.
                 COMM = 807.
                 COMH = 2504
       Note: In the case when the sky is partially obscured, the
       value of 10000 is added on to the lowest reporting level.
       For example, if AIRWAYS report is -X M5 BKN 19 BKN,
       COML would equal 10053.
       
 
COMT - COMx at maximum coverage level
       Example:  COMT = 2504.
 
 
The next two parameters combine the cloud height and coverage
allowing up to three reports which do not necessarily correspond
to low, middle and high level clouds.  These parameters allow a
means of storing cloud reports where there may be more than
one report at a single level.
 
CHCx - Numeric combined cloud height and coverage combined as
       CLHx * 10 + CLCx, where x is the cloud report group 
       number from 1 to 3.
       Examples: CHC1 = 222.
                 CHC2 = 807.
                 CHC3 = 2504
       Note: In the case when the sky is partially obscured, the
       value of 10000 is added on to the first reporting level.
       For example, if AIRWAYS report is -X M5 BKN 19 BKN,
       CHC1 would equal 10053.
 
CHDx - Combined cloud height and short code
       Examples: CHD1 = 22S

the earth's surface of the lowest cloud layer that is reported
as broken or overcast, or the vertical visibility into an
indefinite ceiling.

CEIL - Ceiling in hundreds of feet
