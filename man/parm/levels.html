     LEVELS

     LEVELS specifies the vertical levels to be extracted from the data 
     set.  The coordinate system for the levels is specified in the 
     variable <a href=vcoord.html>VCOORD</a> as PRES, HGHT or THTA.

     LEVELS may be a list separated by semicolons.  The following items 
     may be included in the list:

	a single level;
	MAN for the mandatory levels below 100 mb;
	VAS for the standard VAS levels;
	a range of levels with an increment separated by - .

     The following items are also valid, provided they are not part of a 
     list:

	ALL for all levels;
	a range of levels without an increment.

     SFC or 0 may be entered for surface data.  TOP or -1 is the top level 
     at the station.  These values may not be entered for a range with an 
     increment.

     The flag /MAN may be used after any specification of LEVELS so that
     any application will use only mandatory level data with no 
     interpolation.
