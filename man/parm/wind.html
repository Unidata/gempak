     WIND

     WIND specifies the wind symbol, size, width, type, and head size 
     separated by slashes:

		wind symbol / size / width / type / arrow head size

     The wind symbol contains a letter for symbol type, a letter for symbol 
     units and a color number with no separators.  The character meanings 
     are:

	<a href=type.html>TYPE</a>:	B = BARB	A = ARROW               D = DIRECTIONAL ARROW

	UNITS:	K = KNOTS	M = m/s

	COLOR:	Color number	0 = no wind plotted

     The default is BM1, i.e., barbs in meters/sec plotted in color number 
     1.  If a partial specification is given, the remaining characteristics
     will be taken from the default.

     The wind size is a real number which will be used as a multiplier for 
     the default wind symbol size.  If this number is negative, zero, or 
     missing, the current size will be used.  The sizes for barbs and 
     arrows are independent.
 
     The width is an integer specifying the line width to use in drawing
     the arrows or barbs.

     The type is a four-digit number, FABC, interpreted digit by digit as
     follows:

	    A	                    B	                   C
	1 = plot calm wind   1 = start at stn	     1 = not filled
	2 = ignore calm wind 2 = center at stn	     2 = filled
		             3 = start on sky symbol 3 = not filled with box
						     4 = filled with box

     F is a flag which specifies whether to plot the wind barb on the
     opposite side from where it would normally occur.  If, F is not
     equal to zero, the wind barb is flipped.

     Calm winds are plotted as a circle or an arrowhead for barbs and
     arrows, respectively.  Arrowheads and 50-unit barb flags are filled
     if C=2 or 4.  A box is plotted with background color if C = 3 or 4.
     For example, if <a href=type.html>TYPE</a>=132, a barb will be plotted as a circle if the 
     wind is calm; it will begin on the edge of the cloud cover symbol, 
     and 50-unit flags will be filled.  The default is 111.

     The head size is a real valued multiplier used for the length of the 
     arrow head.  This variable is not used for wind barbs.
