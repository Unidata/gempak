     SNFILE

     SNFILE is the filename for an upper air data set.

     The input for SNFILE may also be a file type. The following file
     type may be input:

		UAIR		observed upper air

     When this file type is input, the program searches locally for the 
     most recent file. If no files are found locally, the program
     searches remotely for the most recent file. The remote directories 
     are specified in the table DATA.TBL.

     An optional base time may be included with the file type name,
     following a bar (|). For example:

                SNFILE = uair | base time

     The base time may be any valid format for a GEMPAK date/time. 
     Any missing parts of the date/time will be supplied by the 
     system time.

     Access to upper air data in the AWIPS database is accomplished by
     setting SNFILE to an alias found in datatype.tbl. Each entry for
     upper air data references an XML control file that needs to be 
     created to specify the attributes of the metadata in the database.
     For example, the alias A2UAIR uses the XML file 
     $GEMTBL/data-access/uair.xml.
