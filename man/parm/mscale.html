     MSCALE
 
     MSCALE specifies the characteristics of a scale legend associated with
     map projections.  The attributes are separated by slashes:

	   fgc;bgc;mask / units / latitude;hide / values / anchor / x;y /
		   length;width / frequency | text_info | title

     fgc is the foreground color which is used to color the labels and the 
     bounding box around the scale legend as well as fill every other box 
     starting with the second box.  bgc is the background color which is used to
     color every other box starting with the first.  If the fgc is 0 or missing,
     no scale legend is drawn.  If bgc is NOT specified it defaults to the 
     default background color, 101.  If ONLY the bgc is specified, the fgc
     defaults to 1.  Finally, a third color may optionally be given to specify 
     a 'mask color'.  This color will be drawn 'underneath' the scale legend
     to enhance its visibility.  If no mask color is given, no mask is drawn.

     Units is the the units for the distance values.  Valid values are 'SM' 
     (Statute Miles), 'NM' (Nautical Miles), and 'KM' (Kilometers).  The
     default value if not specified is SM.
     
     Latitude is the true latitude used to calculate the distance.  If
     missing or invalid, the latitude is computed by taking the average 
     of the upper and lower latitudes of the plot region.  Valid values
     are -85 to 85 inclusive.  'Hide' indicates whether the latitude legend
     'True at' should not appear.  The legend will always be drawn unless the 
     optional hide parameter's first character is Y.
     
     Values can either be an increment, an "increment - end" combination, or 
     a list of values to display separated by a ';'.  If no values are
     specified, the length field is used to calculate values assuming four
     evenly divided increments.  The result is adjusted to be evenly 
     divisable by four, ensuring that integer values are displayed.  
     Similarly, if only an end is specified, four evenly divided increments
     will be displayed.
     
     Anchor describes the location on the scale legend corresponding to
     the location given in the next parameter.  Valid inputs are 
     LL, LC, LR, CL, CC, CR, UL, UC, and UR for lower-left, lower-center, 
     lower-right, center-left, centered, center-right, upper-left, 
     upper-center, and upper-right, respectively.  For example, an 'LL' 
     anchor point, with a x;y of .1,.1, will place the lower-left corner 
     of the scale legend at view coordinates .1, .1.  The default anchor 
     point is 'LL'.

     x;y is the position for the anchor point of the scale legend in view
     coordinates.  The default is 0.025, 0.005.
     
     Length;width are the length and width of the scale legend, normalized to 
     the view coordinates.  The defaults are 0.4 for the length, and 0.01 for 
     the width.  If no values are given, the length field is used to calculate 
     values assuming four evenly divided increments.  The result is adjusted to 
     be evenly divisable by four, ensuring that integer values are displayed.
     
     Frequency describes the distances to be labeled.  If the frequency is
     positive, the labels are plotted on the top of the scale legend.  If
     it is negative, the labels are plotted on the bottom of the scale
     legend.  A value of 0 equals the default value.  The default is 1.

     Text_info describes the scale legend label attributes.  These attributes
     are of the same format as the <a href=text.html>TEXT</a> parameter.  If any part of text_info 
     is missing, then default text information is used.  The user may only 
     change the font type, hardware/software flag, text size and text width.  
     The default values are the bold courier hardware font and text size and 
     text width of 1.

     Title is an optional title (description) that can be added to the scale 
     legend.  It will be placed on the side opposite the legend/labels.
     
     To disable the scale legend, set MSCALE = 0 or leave it blank.

     Examples:

         MSCALE = 1;4			text and bounding box in color 1; 
					every other box in blue; defaults
					for the rest of the input.

         MSCALE = 5/KM/////.25;.1/2	text and bounding box in color 5;
					units in kilometers; length and width 
					.25 and .1 of the view window; every 
					other interval labeled along top 
					side of the scale legend; scale
					legend anchor point at lower-left.

         MSCALE = 1//30//CL/.1;.5	text and bounding box in color 1;
				        units in statute miles; true latitude
 					at 30 north; center-left of the scale 
					legend positioned at .1;.5 in view 
					coordinates.

         MSCALE = 3/NM//10;20;40;80/CL/.1;.5|.55/2/111/1/l/hw	

					text and bounding box in color 3;
					units in nautical miles; true latitude
					computed from maps plot region; 
					center-left of the scale legend 
					positioned at .1;.5 in view 
					coordinates;
					text size of scale legend .55;
					hardware helvetica font; text width
					2; no box around text;left justified.
