     TCMG

     TCMG is the ending valid time for the tropical disturbance, the colors for
     the disturbance symbol, the arrows, and the storm danger area, and the
     name of the center issuing the graphic.

		End time|SY;AR;DA colors|center name

     Tropical disturbances that are valid at the ending time will be plotted on
     the map.  The ending time is given as a GEMPAK date/time string.  Any
     missing items from the string will be filled in by the system time.  The
     ending time may also be LAST.  LAST will use the system time and plot all
     current tropical disturbances.  ALL is not valid for TCMG.

     The colors are separated by a semi-colon.  If any color is set to 0,
     the color will not be changed.  If any color is missing, a default will be
     used.  Defaults are red for the tropical disturbance symbols, orange for
     the track arrows, and magenta, yellow, green, purple, cyan, blue, coral,
     pink, dark green and dark orange for the danger areas for tropical systems
     1 through 10, respectively, in either the Atlantic or Pacific.

     The name of the center is either TPC or CPHC.  If anything other than
     CPHC is specified, the center will default to TPC.  TPC will plot Atlantic
     tropical disturbances and Pacific tropical disturbances east of the
     dateline.  CPHC will only plot Pacific tropical disturbances east of the
     dateline.

     Recommended values of <a href=garea.html>GAREA</a> for use with TCMG are
     <a href=garea.html>GAREA</a> = -4;-104;61;-2     for TPC Atlantic disturbances
     <a href=garea.html>GAREA</a> = -4;-180;41;-80    for TPC Pacific disturbances
     <a href=garea.html>GAREA</a> = -4;180;41;-140    for CPHC Pacific disturbances
