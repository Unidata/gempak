     GRDAREA

     GRDAREA specifies the area to be covered by the grid.  This area is 
     combined with <a href=proj.html>PROJ</a> to define the region over which the grid is evenly 
     spaced.

     GRDAREA can be specified in three ways:

     1.  lat1;lon1;lat2;lon2 
         This defines a latitude/longitude range where (lat1, lon1) is 
         the lower left corner and (lat2, lon2) is the upper right corner.  
         West longitude is negative.
  
         #clat;clon;dlat;dlon
         This defines a latitude/longitude range by the center latitude 
         and longitude.  The lower left corner is (clat-dlat; clon-dlon); 
         the upper right corner is (clat+dlat; clon+dlon).  No corrections 
         are made for the poles or the International Date Line.

     2.  GEOG
         This is an abbreviation for a geographic area defined in the
         GEMPAK geographic table which includes abbreviations for states,
         provinces, and countries, as well as other names. A suffixed + or *
         will decrease the extent of the geographic area. A suffixed - will
         increase the extent of the geographic area.

     3.  STN
         This defines an area centered on a station found in the GEMPAK 
         station table, which currently contains US, Canadian and
         Mexican stations.  A suffixed + or * will expand, and - will reduce
         the area.


     Note that the other ways of specifying <a href=area.html>AREA</a> are not valid for GRDAREA.   
  
     For all projections, the lat/lon corners defined will be used exactly.
     For projections which include the pole, if lat1 = lat2 and lon1 = lon2, 
     then lat1 will specify the range of data from the pole and lon1 will 
     specify the central longitude.  West longitude is negative.
