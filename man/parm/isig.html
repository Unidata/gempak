     ISIG

     ISIG is the ending valid time for the international SIGMET, the colors for
     the thunderstorms, turbulence, hurricanes, tropical storms, tropical 
     depressions, volcanic ash clouds, marked mountain waves, tropical
     cyclones, squall lines, CAT, icing, hail, duststorms, sandstorms,
     cumulonimbus, and low level wind shear, flags for plotting symbols or
     storm names, the start and end times, the message id, the direction and
     speed, and the flight level or the central pressure and maximum wind speed
     associated with a tropical cyclone on the map.

     SIGMETs that are valid at the ending time will be plotted on the map.
     The ending time is given as a GEMPAK date/time string.  Any missing
     items from the string will be filled in by the system time.  The
     ending time may also be LAST or ALL.  LAST will use the system time
     and plot all current SIGMETs.  ALL will plot all the SIGMETs in the data
     files for the last ten days, whether they are active, cancelled, or expired.

     The colors are separated by a semi-colon.  If any color is set to 0,
     that type of symbol will not be plotted.  If any color is missing, a 
     default will be used.  Defaults are cyan for thunderstorm, yellow for 
     turbulence, red for hurricane, red for tropical cyclone, yellow for tropical 
     storm, green for tropical depression, orange for volcanic ash cloud, 
     magenta for marked mountain wave, magenta for squall line, yellow for CAT,
     green for icing, red for hail, orange for duststorm, orange for sandstorm,
     and red for cumulonimbus.

     The symbol flag is YES or NO and controls
	(1)  for thunderstorms and turbulence:  whether or not to plot the
	     symbol at the center of the defined area.
	(2)  for volcanic ash clouds:  whether or not to plot the symbol
	     at the volcano location, if given, or at the center of the
	     defined area.
	(3)  for named storms:  whether or not to display the storm name.
     The default is NO.

     The time flag is YES or NO and controls whether or not to plot the start
     and end times of the SIGMET on the map.  The default is NO.

     The message id flag is YES or NO and controls whether or not to plot the 
     SIGMET message identification and sequence number on the map.  The default 
     is NO.

     The motion flag is YES or NO and controls whether or not to plot the 
     direction in degrees and the speed in knots of the SIGMET.  The default 
     is NO.

     The flight level flag is YES or NO and controls whether or not to plot the
     SIGMET flight level in hundreds of feet on the map.  Or if a tropical
     cyclone is the phenomenon, this position controls whether or not to plot
     the central pressure in mb and the maximum winds in kts.  The default is NO.
