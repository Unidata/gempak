     TAXIS

     TAXIS contains the range, increment and location for labels on a 
     time axis input as:
 
		start-stop-inc;lb;gl;tm
 
     START and STOP are GEMPAK date/times which may be abbreviated.  If 
     the values are omitted, the data range will be used.  The time axis 
     will be reversed if the TAXIS specification begins with R or if the 
     times are input with a later time first.

     INC is the time increment in hours and minutes.  The form for INC 
     is HHHMM.  If one or two digits are entered, hours will be assumed.  
     If INC is omitted, a default appropriate for the range will be used.  
     If the time range exceeds 720 days, the increment is ignored, and an 
     appropriate labelling interval is selected automatically.

     LB, GL, and TM are the frequencies for labels, grid lines, and tick 
     marks.
 
     Examples:
 
	5/12-6/18-6	        Draw the axis from 5/12 to 6/18 with
		                labels at 6-hour increments.


	17/12-20/12-3;2;4;1	Draw the axis from 17/12 to 20/12 with
		                labels at 6-hour increments, grid lines
		                at 12-hour increments, and tic marks at
		                at 3-hour increments.
