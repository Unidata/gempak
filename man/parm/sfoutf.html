     SFOUTF

     SFOUTF is the output surface data file.

     SFOUTF is used in programs which create a new surface data file.  
     It is also used in programs in which data is moved from an input 
     file to an output file, in which case, <a href=sffile.html>SFFILE</a> is the original file.

     When used with program NAMSND, SFOUTF can be used to specify two
     output surface files.  This is done by appending a + to the output 
     file name.  In this case, the second file will have the same name 
     as the first, with the suffix _aux.  The second file will contain 
     surface data for the diagnostic or overflow parameters listed in 
     the auxiliary surface packing file (described in <a href=sfprmf.html>SFPRMF</a>).  For 
     example,

		SFOUTF = new.sfc+

     will create output files new.sfc and new.sfc_aux, if both a primary
     and an auxiliary surface packing file have been provided.
