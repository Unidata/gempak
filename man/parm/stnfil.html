     STNFIL

     STNFIL is the name of a file which contains station information which  
     includes the character identifier, number, name, state, country, 
     latitude, longitude and elevation for each station.
   
     All this information, except the station name, is stored as station 
     header information in surface and sounding data files.
   
     The file SFSTNS.TBL is a surface station table.  
     SNSTNS.TBL is an upper-air table.

     Information in the files must be stored using the exact format used 
     in current tables, since they are read with a FORTRAN FORMAT statement.  
     They may be changed using a text editor.

     WARNING: The variable STNFIL is used for both surface and upper-air
     programs.  Care should be taken that the correct file is specified.
