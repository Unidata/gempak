     STRMID

     STRMID specifies the storm identifier used by programs GPTPC,
     and GPTCWW:

	Storm id/adv num/device/num fcst days/text/track/sz1;sz2/
		lt1;lt2/lw1;lw2/clr1;clr2/disclaimer

     The storm id is the six or eight character storm identifier given
     for each particular storm, for example, AL0300 or EP072001.  The
     inclusion of the 2-digit century is optional.

     The adv num is the number of the advisory that the user
     wishes to see displayed.  Both the storm id and the adv num
     must be specified in order to view a particular storm.  If either
     or both of these fields are blank, the program will get the
     storm(s) to be displayed by comparing the contents of the storm
     history file to the files in the storm advisory directory.  Each
     storm id and advisory number in the history file is checked against
     the storms in the directory.  If a storm advisory is found in the
     directory which has a higher number than the advisory number given
     in the history file for that storm, the new advisory is displayed
     and the history file is updated.  If more than one new storm
     advisory is in the directory for a specific storm, only the latest
     advisory will be displayed.  If new advisories for multiple storms
     are in the directory, the latest new advisory for each storm will
     be displayed.  (If a storm id and advisory number are explicitly
     specified using the STRMID parameter, the history file is neither
     referenced or updated.)  The history file must be a local file
     named 'history.YYYY' for program GPTPC, and 'history_tc.YYYY' for 
     program GPTCWW, where YYYY is the 4-digit year.  It looks like 
     this:

            n
         stormid1_adv1
         stormid2_adv2
           .
           .
           .
         stormidn_advn

     where n is the number of storm identifiers in the file (in I4
     format), and where stormid# is the 8-character storm identifier 
     (e.g., al892001) and adv# is the 3 or 4 character storm advisory number
     (e.g., 009) for the most recently displayed advisory for stormid#.
     Advisory numbers must be in the format NNN or NNNP, where NNN specifies
     the regular numeric (up to 3 digits) advisory number.  Intermediate
     advisories are specified with the format NNNP, where P is either the 
     character 'a' or 'b'.  Program GPTCWW will read an intermediate public
     advisory to obtain updated storm information when necessary.  GPTPC only
     uses information in the forecast advisory, so it ignores the intermediate
     advisory extension (P), and uses only the numeric part of NNNP.

     The device is the device driver to which the graphics will be sent.
     The current choices are limited to XW, GF, PSC and, for GPTPC 
     only, TEST.  If TEST is chosen, the program will display
     the graphics in an XW window only, but the program becomes more 
     interactive than if XW were specified.  With TEST, the user has the 
     option of which graphics to see, and is prompted to move from one 
     graphic to the next.  XW will create four graphics in successive 
     windows for GPTPC with no user intervention.  If no device is 
     specified, the default is GF.  For GPTCWW, a single graphic is 
     created with no user intervention.  Breakpoint information, if 
     required, is gotten from a previously generated local VG file. 

     The num fcst days is the number of forecast days of data to 
     display.  (This field is not used by program GPTPC.)  Permissible
     values are 3 and 5.  The default is 5.

     The text field is not used.

     The track is a flag to plot the cyclone's forecasted track.  If 
     track is N, the track is not plotted. (This field is only used 
     by program GPTCWW.)  The default is Y (yes).

     The sz1;sz2 are the marker size multipliers for the cyclone's
     forecast postion markers.  Both (sz1;sz2), only first (sz1), 
     only second (;sz2) or neither can be specified.  (This field is 
     only used by program GPTCWW.)  Default values are 2;1.5

     The lt1;lt2 are the cyclone's forecast track line types.
     Both (lt1;lt2), only first (lt1), only second (;lt2) or neither
     can be specified.  (This field is only used by program GPTCWW.)
     Default values are 1;3

     The lw1;lw2 are the cyclone's forecast track line widths.
     Both (lw1;lw2), only first (lw1), only second (;lw2) or neither
     can be specified.  (This field is only used by program GPTCWW.)
     Default values are 4;4

     The clr1;clr2 are the cyclone's forecast track line colors.
     Both (clr1;clr2), only first (clr1), only second (;clr2) or neither
     can be specified.  (This field is only used by program GPTCWW.)
     Default values are 32;32

     The disclaimer is a flag to plot the disclaimer text.  If
     disclaimer is N, the text is not plotted. (This field is only used 
     by program GPTCWW.)  The default is Y (yes).
