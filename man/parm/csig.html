     CSIG

     CSIG is the ending valid time for the convective sigmet and convective 
     outlook, the colors for the initial hour (0-hr) CSIG, extrapolated 1-hr
     CSIG, extrapolated 2-hr CSIG, and outlook, and flags for plotting the
     0-hr CSIG sequence number, end time, direction/speed, flight level,
     intensity, 1-hr CSIG sequence number, and 2-hr CSIG sequence number on
     the map.

     Convective sigmets, extrapolated 1-hr and 2-hr CSIGs, and outlooks that
     are valid at the ending time will be plotted on the map. The ending time
     is given as a GEMPAK date/time string.  Any missing items from the string
     will be filled in by the system time.  The ending time may also be LAST
     or ALL.  LAST will use the system time and plot all current convective
     sigmets, extrapolated CSIGs, and outlooks.  ALL will plot all the 
     convective sigmets, extrapolated CSIGs and outlooks in the data files for
     the last ten days, whether they are active or expired.

     The colors are separated by a semi-colon.  If any color is set to 0,
     that line will not be plotted.  If any color is missing, a default will be 
     used.  Defaults are red for 0-hour CSIG, blue for 1-hour CSIG, yellow for
     2-hour CSIG, and green for outlooks.

     The sequence number ID flag (Seq0) is YES or NO and controls whether or
     not to plot the identifying text for the convective sigmets and outlooks
     on the map.  The default is NO.

     The time flag is YES or NO and controls whether or not to plot the end
     time of the convective sigmet and outlook on the map.  The default is NO.

     The movement flag is YES or NO and controls whether or not to plot the
     direction from north in degrees and the speed in knots on the map. The 
     default is NO.

     The flight level flag is YES or NO and controls whether or not to plot the
     flight level in hundreds of feet on the map.  The default is NO.

     The intensity flag is YES or NO and controls whether or not to plot the
     intensity of the area, line or isolated area on the map. The default is NO.

     The sequence number ID flag (Seq1) is YES or NO and controls whether or
     not to plot the identifying text for the extrapolated 1-hr convective
     sigmets on the map.  The default is NO.

     The sequence number ID flag (Seq2) is YES or NO and controls whether or
     not to plot the identifying text for the extrapolated 2-hr convective
     sigmets on the map.  The default is NO.
