    STNTYP

    STNTYP is used to select the data reporting characteristic
    of a station.  Stations will only be listed if they meet
    the selected characterstic(s).

    The valid types are as follows:
	
	A = list all stations
	R = list reporting stations
	M = list missing stations
	U = list stations not in station table
	L = list stations in station table

    The characteristics may be combined.  For example, 
    STNTYP = ML will list missing stations that are in 
    the station table.

    It is necessary to set <a href=area.html>AREA</a> = DSET in order to view any
    unlisted stations.

    IF STNTYP is blank, the default value of 'A' is used.
