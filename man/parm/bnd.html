     BND

     BND specifies the parameters needed for processing bounds areas:

	name[|tag]/color/fillsiz/fillpat/filt/minpts ! 
		lincol/linpat/linwid ! 
		mrksym/col/typ/siz/wid

     FILLING <a href=bounds.html>BOUNDS</a> AREAS:

     name - If name is "BG", then the entire background area in plot coordinates
     	if filled with the given color, pattern, etc.

     tag - The tag option allows specification of a precise subarea to fill, e.g.,
     	fill a particular state instead of filling all the states. See examples.

     color - Additional help for color is available in <a href=colors.html>COLORS</a>.

     fillsiz, fillpat - The fill size is not yet implemented, however the fill 
 	pattern may be set to 1 (solid), 2 (slanted dash) or 3 (slanted line).

     filt - The filter value is used to reduce the number of points used to draw
     	the bound areas.  Valid values for the filter flag are between 0 and 1.
     	The default is 0.

     minpts - The minpts variable allows plotting of only bounds with a number 
 	of points greater than a certain value, thus eliminating numerous small 
 	areas, such as islands.  The overall effect is to increase performance. 
 	Care must be taken, however, since some large geographic areas may be 
 	described with just a few points (e.g., the state of Wyoming).  Usually, 
 	a value of 100 or 200 will suffice.

     OUTLINING <a href=bounds.html>BOUNDS</a> AREAS:

     lincol - Color of bound outline. Additional help for color is available 
	in <a href=colors.html>COLORS</a>.

     linpat - Outline line pattern.

     linwid - Outline line width.

     Note that filt and minpts also apply to outlining.

     PLOTTING A <a href=marker.html>MARKER</a> OR WEATHER SYMBOL AT <a href=bounds.html>BOUNDS</a> CENTROID:

     mrksym - Either "MARK" or "WTHR" to plot either a marker or weather symbol.

     col - Color of marker or symbol. Additional help for color is available 
        in <a href=colors.html>COLORS</a>.

     typ - Marker or weather symbol type (number).

     siz, wid - Marker or symbol size and width.

     NOTE: any or all plot options may be requested at the same time.

     The attributes for multiple bounds may be set by separating the settings
     for each bound with a plus sign (+).

     Examples:

		BND	= bg/4 + state_bnds/23 + lakes/4

		BND	= state_bnds/23 + great_lakes/4

		BND	= state_bnds|<STATE>FL/23
	
			- fills only the state of Florida

		BND	= state_bnds|<STATE>FL/23 ! 2/2/5
	
			- fills only the state of Florida and outlines the
				state of Florida with a dashed red line of
				width 5.

		BND	= state_bnds|<STATE>FL/23 ! 2/2/5 ! wthr/3/65/5/3
	
			- fills only the state of Florida and outlines the
				state of Florida with a dashed red line of
				width 5. Also plots a weather symbol at the
				centroid of the state of Florida. This symbol
				is a green heavy rain symbol of size 5 and 
				width 3.
