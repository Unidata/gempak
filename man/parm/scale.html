     SCALE

     SCALE is the scaling factor for the data.  All data will be multiplied 
     by 10 ** SCALE.  The user specifies the scaling factor for scalar
     grids and/or vector grids by entering:

	scalar / vector
 
     If SCALE is not specified, an appropriate scaling will be selected.
     In the grid programs, a data-dependent scaling will be selected.  In 
     the surface, sounding and the grid to station interpolation programs, 
     a default of 0 will be used.  If no vector scale is specified the 
     scalar scaling factor will be used in its place.

     If the absolute value of SCALE is greater than 5 in a surface or 
     sounding program, a value of 0 will be used.  If the absolute value 
     is greater than 20, a default will be computed in a grid program.
     In the grid to station interpolation program, a default of 0 will
     be used.

     Note that scaling data may create integer overflow problems in 
     programs, such as SFMAP, which round data to the nearest integer.  
     Valid integers must be in the range -2*10**9 to 2*10**9, approximately.
