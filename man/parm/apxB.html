                  GRID DIAGNOSTIC FUNCTIONS


 
The following describes the computation of GEMPAK grid diagnostic 
functions.
 
Each grid in a grid file is identified by a parameter name,
time, level, and vertical coordinate.  A scalar grid is a
single grid, while a vector grid is composed of two grids
containing the u and v components. 
 
The parameter name is used to retrieve a grid from the file, with
a few exceptions:  Certain special parameters will be computed
from other data in the grid file if the parameter name itself is
not found in the grid file.  These special scalar parameters are 

   TMPK    DWPK    TVRK    MIXR*   THTA*   DRCT    TMWK*   THWK 
   TMPC    DWPC    TVRC    SMXR    STHA    SPED    TMWC    THWC*
   TMPF    DWPF    TVRF    MIXS    THTE*   RELH    TMWF    THWF
                   THES*   SMXS    STHE               

where * indicates names which also may be used as operators.
Mixing ratio will be computed automatically from dewpoint
temperature, specific humidity or vapor pressure, if a pressure
grid exists.

The stability indices will be computed automatically from
temperature, dewpoint temperature, and wind speed and direction.
These special scalar parameters are

    CTOT    VTOT    TOTL    KINX    SWET

Haines Indices for fire weather detection will be computed
automatically from temperature and dewpoint at three different
levels.  These scalar parameters are:

    LHAN    Low elevation Haines Index
    MHAN    Middle elevation Haines Index
    HHAN    High elevation Haines Index

The Heat Index, HEAT, will also be automatically computed from the
temperature and relative humidity.

In addition, precipitation will be converted from inches (I) to 
millimeters (M) and vice versa, if the grids are named P__M or
P__I.  The middle numeric characters give the time interval
over which the precipitaion accumulated.  For example, P24M is
a 24-hour precipitation total.

The units for sea surface temperature (SST_), maximum temperature
(TMX_) and minimum temperature (TMN_) will be converted
automatically.  The underscore may be K, C or F.
 
These special scalar parameter names denote constant value grids:

     DTR     Conversion factor for degrees to radians = PI / 180
     E       Base of natural logarithms = 2.71828182
     GRAVTY  Gravitational constant = 9.80616 (note spelling)
     KAPPA   Gas constant/specific heat = 2/7
     PI      3.14159265
     RTD     Conversion factor for radians to degrees = 180 / PI
     nnn     Any number (i.e., 2, -10.2, ... )
 
Another class of special parameter names provides information at 
grid points depending on the navigation of the grid file:
 
     CORL    Coriolis force
             CORL = 2. * OMEGA * SIN ( LATR )
     LATR    Latitude in radians
     LONR    Longitude in radians
     XVAL    Value of the x coordinate in graph coordinates
     YVAL    Value of the y coordinate in graph coordinates
     MSFX    Map scale factor in the x direction
     MSFY    Map scale factor in the y direction
     LAND    Land array; land=1,  sea=RMISSD
     SEA     Sea  array;  sea=1, land=RMISSD

 
Finally, scalar grids may be identified by their location within
the grid file.  The grid number must be prefixed with the symbol
#.  Note that grids may be renumbered as grids are added to or
deleted from the file. 
 
Vector grids are two separate grids containing the u and v 
components.  Special vector parameter names may be used to identify
the following vectors:
 
     WND     Total wind
     GEO*    Geostrophic wind
     AGE*    Ageostrophic wind
     ISAL*   Isallobaric wind
     THRM*   Thermal wind
 
where * indicates names that also may be used as operators.  Note 
that all of these wind vectors will have u and v components in 
meters per second.  The total wind must be stored as UWND and
VWND in the grid file if the components are north relative and
as UREL and VREL if the components are grid relative.
 
Time, level, and vertical coordinate may be specified in GDATTIM,
GLEVEL and GVCORD.  However, any of these values may be 
overridden by in line parameters appended to an operand in the 
form of ^time@level%ivcord.  In-line parameters are only allowed 
for operands, since they modify parameters for individual grids.
The in-line parameters may be entered individually or in 
combinations in any order.

If more than one file is opened, +n may also be used as an
in-line parameter, where n is the number corresponding to the
position of the file name entered in GDFILE.  If +n is omitted,
the first file is used.
 
Grid operators may be nested, allowing a complicated diagnostic 
function to be computed.  One limitation is that layer and
time range operators expect to work on operands read directly
from the grid file or computed from special names.

In the following list of diagnostic operators, scalar operands are
named Si and vector operands are Vi.  Lower case u and v refer to 
the grid relative components of a vector.  All meteorological
output grids are in MKS units, except as noted.  Operators using
PR_ functions are described in the GEMPAK PARAMETER APPENDIX.
All scalar and vector differential operators are valid in any map
projection for which the map scale factors can be computed.  At
present, this applies for the stereographic, cylindrical and conic
projections available in GEMPAK.  In the definitions below, only
the cartesian form of the operators is shown.  The general
curvilinear coordinate forms involving the scale factors are not
given.
    
The operators which are designated for use in polar coordinates are
specific to that coordinate system.

                              MASS * LAV (S) * LAV (v) ] )
	              Note: MASS is computed using the in-line
                            parameter values for V rather than those
                            for S.

MSFC  Psuedo angular momentum (for cross sections)
      MSFC ( V ) = NORMV ( V ) + CORL * DIST

NORM  Scalar vector component normal to a cross section
      NORM ( V ) = DOT ( V, unit normal vector )
                   If the starting point for the cross section is
                   on the left, the unit normal vector points 
                   into the cross section plane.
 
NMAX  Neighborhood maximum value for a radius of influence
      NMAX ( S, ROI ).  ROI is expressed in meters.
      Note:  Masking could be used [e.g., SGT(S1,S2)] to subset
      and filter the scalar grid (S) beforehand to allow for faster 
      processing.
      Warning: The radius of influence should be chosen wisely
      on a high resolution grid where high computational costs could
      result.  Any negative ROI will be set to zero (i.e. at the grid 
      point) and half the distance in the X direction will serve as the 
      upper limit.  

NMIN  Neighborhood minimum value for a radius of influence
      NMIN ( S, ROI ).  ROI is expressed in meters.
      Note:  Masking could be used [e.g., SGT(S1,S2)] to subset
      and filter the scalar grid (S) beforehand to allow for faster 
      processing.
      Warning: The radius of influence should be chosen wisely
      on a high resolution grid where high computational costs could
      result.  Any negative ROI will be set to zero (i.e. at the grid 
      point) and half the distance in the X direction will serve as the
      upper limit.

PLAT  Latitude at each point in polar coordinates
      PLAT ( S )  Note: only the header, which contains the center
                        latitude and longitude, is used.
 
PLCL  Pressure of the lifting condesation level
      PLCL ( PRES, TMPC, DWPC ) = PR_PLCL ( TMPC, PRES, TLCL )
      Note: The temperature of the LCL must be  calculated as 
	    an intermidiate quantity.

PLON  Longitude at each point in polar coordinates
      PLON ( S )  Note: only the header, which contains the center
                        latitude and longitude, is used.

      POIS ( S1, S2 ) where S1 is the forcing function grid and
                            S2 is the boundary value.
      The equation LAP (POIS) = S1 is solved for POIS.
 
POLF  Coriolis force at each point in polar coordinates

                          ( 100 * LDF ( PRES ) )
                   The 100 converts millibars to Pascals.
                   Units are Kelvins / meters / Pascals / seconds**3
		   (note that GRAVTY is included).  PVOR works on a layer
                   in PRES or THTA coordinates.  In isobaric coordinates,
		   the scalar operand, S, is THTA, THTE, or THES.  In
		   isentropic coordinates, the scalar operand, S, is
		   PRES.  Multiplying by 10**6 gives standard PV units.

PVR3  3-D Potential vorticity for a level
      PVR3 ( S, V ) = - CONSTANT * 3D-VOR ( V ) * 3D-GRAD ( S ) 
                   Units are Kelvins / meters / Pascals / seconds**3
		   PVR3 works on a level in PRES or HGHT coordinates.  
                   The constant used is GRAVTY in PRES and is inversly
                   related to DDEN (density) in HGHT.  The scalar 
                   operand, S, is THTA, THTE, THWK, or THES. The 
                   vector, V, has to be GEO or WND.  Multiplying 
                   by 10**6 gives standard PV units.

                   vertical coordinate.

                                 + .0625 * ( S (i+1,j+1) +
                                             S (i+1,j-1) +
                                             S (i-1,j+1) +
