     WARN

     WARN is the ending valid time for the warnings, the colors for
     the severe thunderstorm, tornado and flash flood warnings, a
     flag for plotting the start and stop times, a flag for plotting
     the county names for the warning on the map, a flag to outline
     the county, and a flag to plot warning polygon.

	End time|T-storm color;Tornado color;Flash flood color|Time flag|
		Label flag|Outline flag|Poly flag

     Warnings that are valid at the ending time will be plotted on the map.
     The ending time is given as a GEMPAK date/time string. Any missing
     items from the string will be filled in by the system time. The
     ending time may also be LAST and ALL. LAST will use the system time
     and plot all current warnings. ALL will plot all the warnings in the
     data files, whether they are active, cancelled or expired.

     The colors are separated by a semi-colon.  If any color is set to 0,
     that type of symbol will not be plotted.  If any color is missing, a
     default will be used.  Defaults are cyan for thunderstorm, red for
     tornado, and green for flash flood.

     The time flag is YES or NO and controls whether or not to plot
     the start and stop times of the warning on the map. The default is NO.

     The label flag is YES or NO and controls whether or not to plot
     the county name of the warning on the map. The default is NO.

     The outline flag is YES or NO and controls whether to outline the warned
     county instead of plotting a marker. The default is NO. The outline
     colors are those specified previously.  If a warning is a "test" only, a
     hollow marker will be plotted at the county centroid to indicate this,
     and no outlining will be done.

     The poly flag is YES or NO and controls whether to plot the storm-based
     warning polygon.
