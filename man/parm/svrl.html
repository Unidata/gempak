     SVRL

     SVRL is the ending valid time for the SLS watches, the colors for
     the severe thunderstorm and tornado (SLS) watches, a flag for
     plotting the start and stop times, a flag for plotting the
     county names for the watches on the map, and a flag to outline the
     county.

     SLS watches that are valid at the ending time will be plotted on the map.
     The ending time is given as a GEMPAK date/time string. Any missing
     items from the string will be filled in by the system time. The
     ending time may also be LAST and ALL. LAST will use the system time
     and plot all current SLS watches. ALL will plot all the watches in the
     data files, whether they are active, cancelled or expired.

     The colors are separated by a semi-colon.  If any color is set to 0,
     that type of symbol will not be plotted.  If any color is missing, a
     default will be used.  Defaults are cyan for thunderstorm and red for
     tornado.

     The time flag is YES or NO and controls whether or not to plot
     the start and stop times of the SLS watch on the map. The default
     is NO.

     The label flag is YES or NO and controls whether or not to plot
     the county name of the SLS watch on the map. The default is NO.

     The outline flag is YES or NO and controls whether to outline the SLS
     watch county instead of plotting a marker. The default is NO. The outline
     colors are those specified previously.  If a watch is a "test" only, a
     hollow marker will be plotted at the county centroid to indicate this,
     and no outlining will be done.

     The color code flag is YES or NO, if YES, the colors are associated
     with the last digit of the watch number, otherwise, based on the
     weather type ( tornado or thunderstorm ).
