     SNPARM

     SNPARM is a list of upper air parameters to be used in an upper-air 
     program.

     The four-character parameter names must be separated by semicolons.  
     For example:

		SNPARM = PRES;TMPC;DWPC;THTA

     If a parameter is not present in a data set, the program will attempt 
     to derive it from those parameters which are present.  For example, 
     if pressure, temperature and dewpoint are present in a data set, 
     then relative humidity can be derived. 

     In plotting programs, the position of the parameter determines
     where it will appear with respect to the station location.
     The first position is centered on the station.  The other
     positions are shown below:

				8
			2	10	4
			3	1	5
			6	11	7
				9

     In the example above, DWPC is plotted in position 3.
  
     The layer parameters are computed over a default layer between the 
     specified level and the next level upward in the sounding.  The depth 
     of the layer for layer averages may be specified preceded by ! in the 
     user input.  The shear and RICH calculations can be done relative to 
     a direction by specifying the direction preceded by $ in the user input.

     In-line functions can be used to modify/qualify the output parameters.  
     These functions are applied in the order given; however, arithmetic
     operators must precede other operators.  The function symbols must
     precede the qualifying value and are defined as follows:

	*	multiply			=	equal to
	/	divide			        $	direction
	+	add			        %	vertical coordinate
	-	subtract			!	depth
	<	less than or equal to           
	>	greater than or equal to        

     In the case of wind symbols, the size, line width, type and headsiz
     (arrows) for drawing the symbol may be specified following a colon 
     after the symbol name and after the function specifications if any 
     exist.  The drawing attributes are separated by colons.  The type 
     is a three-digit number, ABC, interpreted digit by digit as follows:

            A                       B                      C
        1 = plot calm wind   1 = start at stn        1 = not filled
        2 = ignore calm wind 2 = center at stn       2 = filled
                             3 = start on sky symbol 3 = not filled with box
                                                     4 = filled with box

     Calm winds are plotted as a circle or an arrowhead for barbs and
     arrows, respectively.  Arrowheads and 50-unit barb flags are filled
     if C=2 or 4. A box is plotted with background color if C = 3 or 4.
     For example, if <a href=type.html>TYPE</a>=122, a barb will be plotted as a circle if the 
     wind is calm; it will be centered on the station location, and 50-unit 
     flags will be filled.  The default is 111.

     Aliases were created to make it easier for the user to plot typical
     sounding data by using pre-set parameters and colors.  To use an
     alias, enter the alias name for SNPARM and leave <a href=colors.html>COLORS</a> blank. If the
     user does not leave <a href=colors.html>COLORS</a> blank, the selected colors will be used 
     instead of the pre-set alias colors.

     See PRMLST.TBL for a list of current aliases for sounding data.
