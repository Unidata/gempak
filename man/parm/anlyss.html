     ANLYSS

     ANLYSS is the average station spacing and the grid extend region
     separated by a slash:

		station spacing / grid extend region

     This information is retrieved from the grid file and used in the 
     objective analysis programs.
  
     The station spacing is in degrees of latitude and is used to compute 
     the weighting functions in the Barnes analysis programs.  The 
     default for the station spacing is twice the grid spacing.

     The grid extend area is specified by four integers, separated by 
     semicolons, which are the numbers of grid points to extend the grid 
     left, down, right, and up.  Only data within the extended grid area 
     is used after the first Barnes pass. The default for the grid extend 
     region is 2;2;2;2.
