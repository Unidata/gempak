     FFA

     FFA is the ending valid time for the flood watches, the colors for
     the flash flood and areal flood watches, a flag for plotting the 
     start and stop times, a flag for plotting the zone names for 
     the storms on the map, a flag for plotting the immediate cause for
     the flooding, and a flag to outline the zone.

	End time|FF color;FA color|Time flag|Label flag|
        Immediate Cause flag|Outline flag/FF;FA line width

     Flood watches that are valid at the ending time will be plotted on 
     the map. The ending time is given as a GEMPAK date/time string. 
     Any missing items from the string will be filled in by the system 
     time. The ending time may also be LAST and ALL. LAST will use the 
     system time and plot all current storm messages. ALL will plot all 
     the messages in the data files, whether they are active, cancelled 
     or expired.

     The colors are separated by a semi-colon.  If any color is set to 0,
     that type of symbol will not be plotted.  If any color is missing, a
     default will be used.  Defaults are red for warning, orange for watch,
     and yellow for advisory.

     The time flag is YES or NO and controls whether or not to plot
     the start and stop times of the storm message on the map. The 
     default is NO.

     The label flag is YES or NO and controls whether or not to plot
     the zone name of the storm message on the map. The default is NO.

     The immediate cause flag is YES or NO and controls whether or not to
     plot the immediate cause of the flooding on the map. The default in 
     NO.

     The outline flag is YES or NO and controls whether to outline the storm
     zone instead of plotting a marker. The default is NO. The outline
     colors are those specified previously.  If a message is a "test" only,
     a hollow marker will be plotted at the zone centroid to indicate this, 
     and no outlining will be done.

     The line widths of warning, watch, and advisory are valid only when
     the outline flag is YES. The line widths are separated by a semi-colon.  
     If any line width is missing or less than 0 or greater than 10, a 
     default value (3) will be used.
