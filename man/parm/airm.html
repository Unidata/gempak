     AIRM

     AIRM is the ending valid time for the airmet, the colors for the
     instrument flight rules, mountain obscuration, turbulence, icing,
     sustained winds and low-level wind shear, and flags for plotting
     symbols or airmet type, the end time, and the flight levels on the map.

	End time|IR;MO;TB;IC;SW;WS clrs|TB color2|Flight lvl|
        low;upper filter lvl| Symbol flg|Time flg|Flight lvl flg|Start time flg

     Airmets that are valid at the ending time will be plotted on the map.
     The ending time is given as a GEMPAK date/time string.  Any missing
     items from the string will be filled in by the system time.  The
     ending time may also be LAST or ALL.  LAST will use the system time
     and plot all current airmets.  ALL will plot all the airmets in the data
     files for the last ten days, whether they are active, cancelled, updated
     or expired.

     The colors are separated by a semi-colon.  If any color is set to 0,
     that type of symbol will not be plotted.  If any color is missing, a 
     default will be used.  Defaults are red for instrument flight rules,
     yellow for mountain obscuration, light blue and magenta for turbulence,
     green for icing, dark pink for sustained winds and cyan for low-level
     wind shear.

     TB color2 is the second color for turbulence. The color from the first
     list will be used to plot Turbulence AIRMETs below the specified level.
     The color listed as the second color will be for Turbulence AIRMETs
     above the specified level.
     
     Flight lvl is the dividing level for the turbulence display. The value
     is in hundreds of feet.       

     The lower and upper filter levels are flight level values used to filter
     the AIRM data display. If neither value is given, then all data is plotted.
     If only the lower level is present, then only data above that level is
     displayed. For the upper level only, data below this upper value are
     displayed. If both values are given, then the data is plotted for levels
     between the two boundary values.

     The symbol flag is YES or NO and controls whether or not to plot a symbol
     or identifying text for the airmet on the map.  The default is NO.

     The time flag is YES or NO and controls whether or not to plot the end
     time of the airmet on the map.  The default is NO.

     The flight level flag is YES or NO and controls whether or not to plot the
     flight level(s) in hundreds of feet on the map.  The default is NO.

     The start time flag is YES or NO and controls whether or not to use the 
     AIRMET issue time (YES) or the AIRMET beginning valid time (NO) for plotting 
     the data.  The dafault is YES.
