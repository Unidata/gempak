NMCGRD transfers grids from a NMC file to a GEMPAK grid file.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION                                                             
                                                                                
    This program transfers grids from an NMC grid file into a
    GEMPAK grid file.  If the GEMPAK file does not exist, it is
    created using MAXGRD and CPYFIL in the same manner as GDCFIL.

    CPYFIL may also be used to specify the output grid as a subset
    of the input grid.  If the output grid is a proper subset of
    the input grid, then specify CPYFIL as follows

    		CPYFIL = #nnn>#mmm

    This will tell NMCGRD to read grid number nnn and subset it
    to grid number mmm.
 
    GDFILE may be set to list, if so, no GEMPAK file is created.
    Instead, a listing of the contents of the NMC file is printed
    on the terminal.

    GDEFIL specifies the name of the NMC file followed by 
    optional qualifiers preceded by *'s.  The information after
    the first * is interpreted the following way:

            Blank or no *   =>   GRIB data
            *SEQ            =>   Office Note 84 Sequential
            *DIR            =>   Office Note 84 Direct Access
                                 (NMC archive file)
            *###            =>   ### is the Office Note 84
                                 starting word number

    The information following the second * is the grid time type:

            Blank or no *   =>   F (forecast) assumed
            *A              =>   Analysis
            *F              =>   Forecast
            *G              =>   Guess
            *I              =>   Initialization

                                                                                

EXAMPLES:


     1. Create a grid file called NEW.GRD from the information                   
        within grid file OLD.GRD.  Read Office Note 84 grids from
        sequential NMC file named NGM.GRD.  List the grids
        being transfered on the screen.

        GDFILE  = new.grd
        OUTPUT  = t
        GDEFIL  = ngm.grd*seq
        MAXGRD  = 2000
        CPYFIL  = old.grd

     2. Create a grid file by subsetting grid 104 to grid 105.
	The contents of the file are analysis fields.

	GDFILE = new.grd
	CPYFIL = #104>#105
	GDEFIL = ngm104.grd*seq*a
