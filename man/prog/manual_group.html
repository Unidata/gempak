                                 MANUAL GROUP


This pop-up is located under the "Arrange" pull-down menu and can be invoked 
by clicking "Manual-group," or by typing CTRL-G in the NTRANS panel.

The "Frame Selection" panel allows selection of incremental search or string 
search.  Radio buttons are provided for selection one of the searching methods.
Incremental Searching is the default.

In incremental searching, a starting frame number, an incremental step number 
and an end frame number are required as input.  Once the "Apply" button in this 
panel is clicked, the frames that correspond to the starting, ending and 
incremental numbers will be highlighted in the "Frame List" Panel.  Hitting 
the RETURN (ENTER) KEY when one of the input dialogue text boxes is active 
will have the same effect as clicking the "Apply" button.

String searching provides an easy alternative way to select frames.  The user 
can type a key string into the "Search" dialogue box, then click the "Apply" 
button or hit RETURN.  All the frames whose names contain the key string as 
substring will be highlighted in the Frame List Panel.

The "Clear" button is designed to de-select all of the current highlighted 
items.

     NOTE:  The desired selection method should be set first.

The "List of Frames" panel consists of a scrolled list of frame titles.  All 
the frame titles are listed with their frame order index.

To select a frame, click on the chosen title with the left mouse button.  
Each item is in toggle mode, which means if you click on the highlighted item, 
that item will be de-selected.

The "List of Groups" panel consists of a scrolled list of group names.  To 
select a frame, click on the chosen title with the left mouse button.  Each 
item is in toggle mode, which means if you click on the highlighted item, 
that item will be de-selected.

The "Group Name Dialogue Box" is used for entering the desired group name 
for the currently selected group of frames.  A group name is required before 
clicking the "Add & Display" or "Add to List" buttons.  Hit the RETURN key 
when the mouse pointer is inside the text dialogue box to initiate the 
"Add to Group List" button -- the currently defined group will be saved into 
the group list and the system is ready for the next grouping process.

The "Add to List" button assigns the current set of highlighted frames to 
the group name in the Group Name Dialogue Box, and saves this group into 
the Group List.  The frame selections are cleared so that a new group may 
be defined.

The "Add & Display" button will perform the "Add to Group List" function 
and load the current group for viewing.  The group generation panel will 
disappear.  When the main NTRANS menu bar becomes active, the group loading 
process is finished.

The "CANCEL" button de-activates the current pop-up window.
