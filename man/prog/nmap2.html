 nmap2  

 nmap2 [option flags] [spf file name]

    Valid option flags:

       -s  -- indicates an spf file name is specified.  The
              sp file name MUST follow the -s flag and may or may
              not be separated by a space.

       -a  -- indicates an automatic load of data should take
              place.  Is meaningless unless a valid spf file
              has been specified.

       -v  -- indicates a VGF name is specified. The VG file name
              MUST follow the -v flag and may or may not be separated
	      by a space.

       -h  -- shows this usage file.


    An spf file is either a relative or full path to a valid
    spf file.  If the -a option is included, this file will be
    read and the data will be loaded without any user interaction.
    If the -a option is not included, then the data will be set
    in nmap2's data window but the user interaction will be
    required before data is loaded.

    example:

       nmap2 -as example.spf

       nmap2 -v sfc_fronts.vgf


    Command line parsing may be directed to halt with a double 
    dash ("--").  This is useful if the user wants to send command 
    line options to the window manager.  Nmap2 ceases parsing 
    command line options at the "--", and passes everything that 
    follows the doubledash on the command line to the window 
    manager. 

    example:
   
       nmap2 -- -xrm "*Page:0 0 1" &
