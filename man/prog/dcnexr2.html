DCNEXR2 (Unidata)

    DCNEXR2 is used to receive the Level II NEXRAD data from the
    CRAFT IDD data stream. Products are received in BZIP2 compressed pieces
    from a file or data stream fed to the program through standard input, 
    and appended to an output file for use with display programs.
    The program is controlled by inputs to the command line.


    The inputs are program options, and the output file name.
    For example: 
    
	dcnexr2 [options] output_file

   By default, the program initially prepends a "." to the output file name, 
   and renames the file upon closing in order to make it easier for
   programs to determine when a file is complete. Subsequent writes to
   an existing file bypass adding the leading "." to the filename.

   The only useful option to the program is "-s STID" which allows the user
   to specify a 4 character station ID to be written in to the output data
   file in bytes 21-24 of the Archive2 Level II data header, which allows 
   programs to identify the source of the radar data without having to 
   rely on a file name convention.
