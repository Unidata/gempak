NMCSHP decodes surface ship data in NMC archive
format and writes it to a GEMPAK ship data file.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION                                                             
                                                                                
    NMCSHP decodes surface ship observations in NMC Office
    Note 29/124 format and writes it to the GEMPAK surface
    ship file given by SHIPFL.  AREA is entered as the
    southwestern and northeastern corner points of the
    region over which stations will be included.

    The NMC raw data file name is entered by specifying SFEFIL.
    The file may be either EBCIDC or ASCII data.

    NMCSHP will create an GEMPAK surface ship file if SHIPFL
    does not already exist using TIMSTN to set the number
    of times and ships to included in the file.
