                                NWX OVERVIEW


NWX displays text products from the Family of Services (FOS) data feed.  A 
Motif graphical user interface controls the program functions.

A graphical method is used to select the text products for display.  NWX 
utilizes two windows:  one displays a map with markers representing stations 
that issue the desired text product, and the other displays the desired text.  
Data types that can be represented at individual locations are plotted as 
markers on a map.  The text products are displayed in a text window by 
clicking on the desired location with the cursor mouse.  By default, the 
latest products are displayed.  Earlier versions of the product may be viewed 
by using the "Previous" and "Next" options.

The displayed map region can be changed to accommodate different data types.  
A number of predefined areas are listed in the MAP_AREA menu.  Zooming in on 
any area is also supported by drawing a bounding box with the mouse cursor.
