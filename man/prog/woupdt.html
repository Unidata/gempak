WOUPDT

    WOUPDT creates the Watch Outline Update (WOU) text product for each 
    active watch number. This program reads the most recently decoded 
    Watch County Notification (WCN) files and creates a list of active 
    counties for a given watch number. If a WFO id in the WOU was not found
    in the WCN files, then that WFO's county information is taken from the
    last WOU.  Once all of the active counties have been found, the county 
    list is then formated into a WOU ASCII text file.

    In addition to creating the updated WOU text products, WOUPDT also creates 
    the Watch Corner Points (WCP) text product from the active watches.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    The inputs for WOUPDT are the flags WOUPDT used to check for data
    changes and the date and hour that the WOU is to be run.  The time is given
    in GMT and it follows the same rules as the GEMPAK parameter DATTIM. 
    Keywords, LAST and ALL are not allowed.

    If no arguments are given on the command line then the system clock 
    time will be used as the input time.

    The output file naming convention is:

                ####_YYYYMMDDHHNN.wou

    where:

    	#### 	= 	active watch number
    	YYYY 	=	Year
    	MM	=	Month
    	DD	=	Day
    	HH	=	Hour
    	NN	=	Minutes


    The flag options; '-e', '-c', '-o', '-u' and '-h', are optional. If no flag 
    is used, then an updated WOU message is created whenever the program is run. 
    If the '-h' option is used, the help file for WOUPDT is displayed and the
    program exits. The '-e' flag creates an updated WOU if it found a EXA, EXT
    or EXB in the decoded WCN file. Using the '-c' flag creates a cancel WOU 
    message if a previous cancel message for that watch number does _not_ 
    exist and if the remaining WFOs with active counties have cleared them 
    before the ending time of the watch, or if the watch has expired and the 
    run time is within the (end time + delta minutes).  The '-o' flag option 
    creates an updated WOU message if there have been regular clearing of 
    counties since the last WOU message. The '-u' flag will create an updated
    WOU message if county and time difference aspects are met. First is the
    time difference between the current time and the most recent decoded WOU
    message; delta time. Second is the use of a time threshold value, 
    UPDT_UNIQUE_MINS. Third, is if counties have been cleared from the watch.
    Below are the contiditions on whether or not an updated message will be
    created:
       1. no change in counties and delta time < UPDT_UNIQUE_MINS - don't issue 
       2. a change in counties and delta time < UPDT_UNIQUE_MINS -  issue 
       3. no change in counties and delta time > UPDT_UNIQUE_MINS - issue 
       4. a change in counties and delta time > UPDT_UNIQUE_MINS -  issue 


    The date/time input is used to construct the output file names.  The 
    aliases, WOU and WCN, are used to search the file directories and 
    use the templates, YYYYMMDDHH.wou or YYYYMMDDHH.wcn, from the 
    datatyp.tbl file.  The aliases, WOU and WCN, also sets a value for 
    the path to the decoded WOU and WCN files.  These paths are defined by
    the environment variable $OBS.  This environment variable must be 
    set by the site administrator.

    The table, woudef.tbl, is used by WOUPDT to set the delta time (in 
    minutes) after the watch expiration time and the path to the original
    watch text file, ww####.txt, where, ####, is the watch number. The delta
    time parameter is 'WOU_CNL_PLUS_MIN'.  If the table cannot be found or if
    the delta number cannot be converted a default value of 15 minutes is set. 
    The search path parameter is 'WOU_SRCH'. This directory list is separated
    by a ':' and the file name is represented by "%N" in each directory. If this
    parameter is not set, the watch file, ww####.txt, will only be searched for
    in the local directory.

    Also found in woudef.tbl, are the settings for using the VTEC string in the
    Watch Outline Update-initial (WOUi) and WOU update. There are separate 
    settings for the WOUi and WOUPDT for use of the VTEC line, product type 
    code, originating office identifier and the significance code. The product
    type code for the WOU-i will be set to 'T' if the watch is issued as 'TEST'.
    Also, only the action code for the WOUi is listed in the table. For 
    WOU-update the code is set to 'CON' for continuing update messages. The 
    WOU-final text message, if the WFOs cancel all of the counties before the 
    ending time of the watch, the WOU-final product code and action codes are:
    'E' and 'CAN'. There will be 'EXPERIMENTAL...' leading the watch number MND 
    line. If the watch is allowed to expire at it's normal ending time, the 
    product and action codes are, 'O' and 'EXP', respectively. There will not be 
    anything added to the MND watch number line.

PROGRAM METHODOLOGY FOR CREATING THE WCP TEXT PRODUCTS

    As the WOUPDT loops over the active watches, information about each watch is
    stored locally so that a WCP text product can be created. The latitude and
    longitude pairs found for each watch in the WCP comes from rebundling the
    active counties found by the update program.  Currently, in the WCP, there 
    are 7 lat/lon pairs calculated for each watch.  If there are not any active
    watches, a WCP text file is created stating that currently, there are not
    any active watches.  Control of creating the WCP text product is found in 
    $GEMTBL/txtprd/woudef.tbl. The controlling tag value is UPDT_WCP, it's 
    default value is OFF.  The output WCP text file name is KWNSWCPSPC.  When 
    the WCP text product is created, a VG file, KWNSWCPSPC.vgf, is also created. 
    If there are not any active watches, an emtpy VG file is created. Control 
    for creating a VG file is found in $GEMTBL/txtprd/woudef.tbl with the tag 
    WCP_VGF. It's default value is set to FALSE.  
    

PROGRAM METHODOLOGY FOR TIME STRINGS

    WOUPDT uses three time strings to determine if a WCN report for a WFO
    is the most current county information. These times are: the bulletin 
    issue time, watch start time and watch end time.

    To collect the most recently sent WCNs for a given watch number, the
    user date/time is compared to the WCN's report bulletin time, start 
    time and end time.  If the user date/time is greater than or equal to
    the bulletin issue time, greater than or equal to the watch start time
    and less than or equal to the watch's end time; that decoded report
    will be considered for storing it's county information. 

    The active watch number is then compared to the decoded watch number. If 
    the watch numbers match, WOUPDT then checks to see if that WFO ID and it's 
    information has been previously saved.  If not, that WFO's information 
    and counties are stored.
