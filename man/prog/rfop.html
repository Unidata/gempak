RFOP

  RFOP converts a VGF NWS Flood Outlook Product file into an ASCII NWS 
  Flood Outlook Product file. Unfilled closed lines are assumed to be
  areas of possible flooding, hatch filled areas are assumed to be areas
  of likely flooding, solid fill areas are assumed to be areas of
  imminent or occurring flooding.

INPUT PARAMETERS

  rfop vgf_filename

  rfop		Program name
  vgf_filename	VGF file to be converted

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

  RFOP scans a VGF file and generates a text description of each line.
  The output file format is:
NWS NATIONAL FLOOD OUTLOOK PRODUCT yymmdd/hhmm
line1npts category valid_dates
lon1, lat1
lon2, lat2
lon3, lat3
...
lonN, latN
line2npts category valid_dates
...

  Flood categories are:
  0 - flooding possible
  1 - flooding likely
  2 - flooding occurring or imminent

EXAMPLES

  If the VGF file 'testfile.vgf' contained a single 4-point line with
  no fill, then the output would look like:

NWS NATIONAL FLOOD OUTLOOK PRODUCT 020321/1223
4 0 Mar 21 - Mar 23
  45.53 -69.08
  44.40 -67.62
  44.11 -67.51
  45.22 -69.02

  If the VGF file 'testfile.vgf' contained a single 5-point line with
  solid fill, then the output would look like:

NWS NATIONAL FLOOD OUTLOOK PRODUCT 020321/1223
5 2 Mar 21 - Mar 23
  45.53 -69.08
  44.40 -67.62
  44.11 -67.51
  45.22 -69.02
  45.39 -70.07
