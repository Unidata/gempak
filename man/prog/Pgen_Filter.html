		 	  Product Generation Filter


I.  Functionality

The filter allows the selective display and edit of vg elements by element
forecast time.  The filter facilitates creating a product or products that 
spans multiple times, or using a previous time to generate a product at a new 
time.  The filter only applies to elements with an embedded forecast time.  At 
present this includes only the MET class elements of AIRMET, non-convective 
SIGMET, and the GFA.  These elements may be selectively displayed and edited 
by time.  All other elements are not affected by the filter and will always be 
drawn and can be selected.


II. Operation

Click the "FILTER" button in the "Actions" section of the product
generation palette ("pgpalette") to start the time filter.  The "Filter 
Control" GUI is activated.  

The "Filter Control" GUI remains visible while in product filtering mode.  This
GUI controls which time or times is/are active by means of the check boxes.  
The filter control starts with no times selected.  If there are any GFA 
elements drawn, they will disappear when the filter control starts up.  The 
elements still exist, however they are not displayed.  The user can select one 
or more times to display by checking one or more check boxes on.  As soon as a 
check box is turned on all GFA, AIRMETs and SIGMETs which have a forecast hour 
that exactly matches one of the selected times will be displayed.  Please note 
this is an exact match.  The "0" time matches the "0" forecast hour, while the 
"0-6" time (a smear time) matches the forecast time of "0-6", and does not 
match "0", "3", "6", etc.


The "All On"/"All Off" button is a shortcut mechanism which turns all the
filter check boxes on or off with a single click.  Note that this button starts
as "All On".  It toggles to the opposite state after each click, so if it is 
"All On" then it becomes "All Off" and vice versa.

The Filter Control includes hot keys to enable the user to step from one time 
to the next.  These are the "[" and "]" keys.  The "[" key steps the control 
from right to left and the the "]" steps from left to right.
