This is the HELP information for the GEMPAK user interface.

The following commands may be entered after the GEMPAK-PROGRAM> prompt,
where "PROGRAM" is the name of the current GEMPAK program.  These
commands may be abbreviated so long as the abbreviation is unique and
may be either upper or lower case.  In a parameter assignment command,
a parameter name may be abbreviated to the extent that it remains
unique among all the other parameters used by that program.  If HELP
information is sought for a parameter not in the current program, the
full parameter name must be entered.  For HELP information on any
program, the full program name must be entered.

In the command summary below, optional information is enclosed by [...].

The following commands show parameter names, definitions and values:

  DISPLAY [NAME]    Lists definitions and values of all program
                    parameters or of the single specified parameter NAME

  LIST    [NAME]    Lists values of all the program parameters or of the
                    single specified parameter NAME

These commands permit access to HELP information:

  HELP              Types this HELP information on the screen

  HELP     NAME     Types HELP information for program or parameter NAME

  PHELP   [NAME]    Same as HELP, but the output is paged

The following commands assign values to the parameters:

  PARM =   xyz      Assigns value xyz to PARM

  PARM =  &PARM2    Assigns values of PARM2 to PARM

  RESTORE [FILE]    Recalls parameter values stored by SAVE [FILE]

  SAVE    [FILE]    Save values of parameters for future RESTORE

  CURSOR  PARM      Assigns value to PARM based on user input from the
                    mouse button [GAREA, GAREAX, CGAREA, CGAREAX, 
		    GPOINT and CXSTNS are the only valid inputs for PARM]

The following commands manipulate display windows:

  LUT     FILE      Loads a color look-up table stored in FILE

  WINDOW  NAME      Raises the window specified by NAME to the top.

  CLOSE   NAME      Closes the window specified by NAME

  GSAVE   FILE      Saves the current frame to the file specified by FILE

These commands allow manipulation of an existing animation sequence:

  ;LOOP             Starts forward animation of the sequence
                    (The loop is stopped by a single click in the output
                    graphics window.)

  ;REVERSE          Starts backward animation the of sequence
                    (The loop is stopped by a single click in the output
                    graphics window.)

  ;STEP             Step one frame forward

  ;BACK             Step one frame backward

  ;#                Set the dwell rates to group #
                    (# can be any number from 1-5. One has the slowest
                    loop speeds and 5 has the fastest.)

The following command will return the current version number of GEMPAK:

  VERSION           Write the current version number to the screen

There are two commands to control execution of the program:

  EXIT              Exit from the current GEMPAK program

  RUN               Runs the current program with the current parameter
                    values
