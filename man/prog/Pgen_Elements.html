                         PRODUCT GENERATION ELEMENTS


The following is a description of some of more specialized elements available 
in product generation, as well as instructions in their major features.


Element		Class

AIRMET		MET	Note that this is NOT the AIRMET under class SIGMET.

	Airmets have an Area name, which is defined in the airmet.tbl (in 
        $GEMTBL/pgen), a color, a Station, sequence number, forecast hour, and
        two flight levels, top and bottom.  There is also a From Line which is
	derived from the point locations after the AIRMET figure is drawn.

        In product generation the AIRMET is displayed as a closed line with an
	associated text box containing the AIRMET type, sequence number, flight
	levels, and forecast hour.

	To draw an AIRMET, click on Class MET, then Object AIRMET.  The AIRMET
	attributes window will appear.  Click with the left mouse button on the
	main window to identify the points of the AIRMET.  As the mouse is moved
	between these points, the resulting figure will be temporarily drawn with
	a white line.  Once all the points have been identified, click on the 
	middle mouse button.  The From Line will now be calculated and will 
	appear in the AIRMET attribute box.  The white line that temporarily 
	described the AIRMET figure will be replaced with the real line in the
	correct color and a white rectangle will appear and move with the mouse.  
	This box roughly describes the dimensions of the AIRMET text box.  Move 
	the mouse to the desired location and click on the left mouse button.  
	The text will appear centered on that location.  

	After one AIRMET is drawn another may be drawn using the same procedure
	described above, or the draw mode may be exited by clicking on the 
	middle mouse button.  The AIRMET attribute window will disappear at
	this point.

	To edit an AIRMET, click on class MET and action Select (arrow button)
	and click on a previously drawn AIRMET in the main window.  The AIRMET 
	attribute window will appear with the information from that airmet.  
	In order to change the AIRMET's attributes, make the desired change(s)
	in the attribute window and click on Apply.  In order to change the 
	shape of the AIRMET, click on a point, keep the mouse button held
	down (i.e. do not release the button) and move the mouse to the desired
	location.  When the mouse button is released the AIRMET will be redrawn
	with the new point location and the From Line will be updated.  To move
	the text, click on Move Text on the attribute window.  The temporary 
	text box will follow the cursor.  A left mouse button click identifies
 	the new location for the text.  

	To create the From Line text file, click on the Save button.  A Save 
	confirmation window will appear.  It will contain the AIRMET's from line
	and file name.  Click on either Save to write this to the indicated 
	file (all writes are to the local directory from which nmap2 was started) 
	or Cancel to abort the operation.  The file name will be in this format:

	 	ZULU_#.frm	for Icing
		TANGO_#.frm	for Turbulence	
		SIERRA_#.frm	for all other AIRMETs

	The # will be the sequence number.
