                     OBSERVED DATA SOUNDINGS


The OBSERVED SOUNDING SELECTION window allows the user to plot 
soundings stored in GEMPAK upper air format data files. The
data set choices are defined in $NAWIPS/tables/nsharp/nsharp_observed.tbl,
and reference the datatype.tbl template/aliases. Any GEMPAK upper air 
file may be used by choosing the "BROWSE" option in the file list. 
Typical sources of observational soundings include radiosonde
and dropsonde reports.

After selecting the GEMPAK upper air source, the available times will 
be displayed in the "Sounding times" list. The "00Z and 12Z only"
toggle provides a shortcut for displaying the standard sounding times
without other times received. A single or multiple times may be selected
from the list. A range of times is selected by clicking a starting
time and dragging the mouse pointer, or by selecting the first time
and then depressing <SHIFT> while selecting the second time.
Individual times may be added by depressing <CTRL> when selecting
additional times.

After selecting the desired times from the available times list, the 
sounding location is selected using the available stations displayed on 
the selection map. The available report locations from the most recent 
selected time are displayed. The location for which soundings are computed 
is obtained by positioning the mouse pointer over the desired point and clicking mouse button 1. 

The map AREA may be set using the predefined map regions, while
ZOOMing is accomplished through the use of a rubber band box.
UNZOOMing will restore the image to the current AREA.

Select "Cancel" to close the sounding selection window without
changing the current sounding display. The sounding selection window will
close after a sounding location is chosen from the map display.
