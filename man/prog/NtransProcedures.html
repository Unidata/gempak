                              NTRANS Procedures


I. Functionality

NTRANS provides the capability to save and restore multipanel information 
by using NTRANS Procedure Files (NPFs).  The following information can be 
saved and retrieved from an NPF for up to 36 Panels:

        A. Total number panel columns and rows
        B. Model source Metafile name 
        C. Valid Time Set Flag
        D. Panel location by column and row
        E. Source Metafile group name

The latest times are used for each NPF specified Metafile. 

II.  Operation

Save and restore functions are accessed by selecting the "Save Procedure File" 
and "Restore Procedure File" under the "Procedures" pull down menu.

The "Save Procedure File" function saves panel information to a user selected
ASCII NPF for all of the panels loaded by the "Select Model" and "Select Group"
GUIs. For example, suppose 2 panels are loaded into the display with panel 1 
contains the GFS 1000-500 Thickness and Sea Level Pressure and panel 2 contains
the GFS 500 Geopotential Height and Vorticity.  To save this information to an 
NPF, click the "Save Procedure File" under "Procedures" in the menu bar which 
invokes the "Save to NPF file" GUI.  This GUI allows the user to select an 
existing NPF name or to specify a new NPF name.  The "Save to NPF file" GUI 
operates in a similar fashion as the VGF open/save GUI.  NPFs are listed in the
GUI by directory name.  Directory names are specified in the table, 
GEMTBL/nmap/npf.nmap.

The "Restore Procedure File" function loads the NTRANS Display with panel 
information specified in an NPF. To retrieve a desired NPF click the 
"Restore Procedure File" from the "Procedures" menu.  The "Restore from NPF 
file" GUI is invoked which presents the same list of directories and NPFs as 
the "Save from NPF file" GUI discussed above. Select the desired NPF from the 
scroll list and click the "OK" button.  A "Restore Confirmation" GUI is invoked
which lists the data source and dominant data for each loop.  Click the 
"Accept" or "Cancel" button to fill the "Data Selection Window" GUI, or to 
select another NPF, respectively.

III.  NPF Creation, Editing and Error Processing

The NPF is an editable ASCII file.  It is recommended that the "Save Procedure 
File" menu button under "Procedures" be used to save procedures instead of 
creating an NPF from scratch.  In this way the user is assured that the NPF 
will have the correct format and operate as intended.  The "Save Procedure
File" function automatically adds a prolog to the NPF including account name 
and creation date.

A user edited NPF has the potential for improper formatting and errors.
Invalid NPF entries are handled according to the following rules.

A.  Invalid entries in NPF are noted in "Error Messages" pop-up upon 
    restore.

B.  No attempt is made to restore a data set with invalid data 
    source values. The panel will be remain blank as the rest of the valid
    data sources are restored. 

C.  If the Valid Time Set variable is set for an invalid data source entry,
    the remaining source will load all frames in the saved group.

IV. NPF Syntax

The NPF has two columns.  The first column is a reserved keyword that indicates
the panel attribute.  The second column is the value for that panel attribute.
Keywords and their values are grouped by panel in the file. The exclamation 
point, !, precedes comment lines in the file.

The following table lists the reserved keywords and their valid values 
specified in the Definitions section.

    <reserved keyword>  	Valid value(s)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

    <total_columns>             C

    <total_rows>                R

    <panelN_source>	     	Data Source 

    <panelN_validTimeSet>    	D

    <panelN_column>      	W

    <panelN_row>	       	X

    <panelN_group>        	Metafile group name

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Definitions:

    Data Source : Metafile model directory and Metafile File name
                  e.g., gfs/gfs_[cycle_date]_[cycle_hour]_us
    N : panel number, the order in which the files are to be loaded
        (integer,  0 < N < 36 )
    C : Total number of Columns in display (integer, 0 < C <= 6)
    R : Total number or Rows in Display (integer, 0 < R <= 6)
    D : Valid Set Time Variable number (integer, D > 0)
    W : Panel column location in display (integer, 0 <= W < 6)
    X : Panel row location in display (integer, 0 <= X < 6  )
    Metafile group name: Name of model group in Metafile to load
			 e.g. MSLP, 1000-500 THKN

Note 1:
-------
	The <panelN_validTimeSet> will be set to zero by default. The entry 
	with a value greater than 0 will be loaded first and any following
	entries will load only those times matching those of the initial 
	source.
