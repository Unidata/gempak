DCAIRM

    DCAIRM decodes airmet (AIRman's METeorological Information)
    reports from a real-time data feed, or from a file fed to the 
    program through standard input, and writes the data to an ASCII 
    file.  The program is controlled by inputs to the command line.

    The inputs are program options and the output file name or template.
    For example, for real-time data feeds:
    
	dcairm [options] output_file

    If running the program interactively with standard input, the -c
    option must be used.  The input file must also be specified.
    For example:

	dcairm -c YYMMDD/HHNN [other_options] output_file < input_file
    
    A template may be used to specify the output file name.  The file
    name template uses the date and time of the bulletin or report
    to replace the following characters.

	YYYY or YY	Year with or without the century
	MM		Month number
	DD		Day
	HH		Hour
	NN		Minute


     The format of the output ASCII file is as follows:

     |Type|Issue_time|Start_time|End_time|Identifier|Update|Flt_lvl_1|
           Flt_lvl_2|Corr_amd_tst_flag|Cancel_flag
	     Lat1    Lon1
	     Lat2    Lon2
	     Lat3    Lon3
	       .       .
	       .       .
	       .       .

     (Note that the first two lines shown above appear as a single
     line in the output file.)
     Where: Type is IR (instrument flight rules), MO (mountain
 	    	obscuration), TB (turbulence), IC (icing),  
                SW (sustained winds), or WS (low-level wind shear).
	    Issue_Time, Start_time and End_time are full GEMPAK 
                date/time strings
	    Identifier is composed of the region and a sequence number
	    Update is the airmet update number
	    Flt_lvl_1 and Flt_lvl_2 are the flight levels
	    Corr_amd_tst_flag is a flag indicating a correction (1),
		an amendment (2), and/or a test (flag + 3)
	    Cancel_flag is a flag indicating a cancellation (0 or 1)

     Extra spaces may appear anywhere in this line of information,
     except in the first character position.  The first character must
     be a bar (|).

     The latitude and longitude values are read using the FORTRAN
     format (2F9.2).  The number of points may vary.
