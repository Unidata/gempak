PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
 
    OABSFC performs a Barnes objective analysis on surface
    data.  Multiple parameters may be analyzed at the same
    time.  If more than one time is entered, the analyses
    will be performed sequentially.

    The input surface file is specified in <a href=../parm/sffile.html>SFFILE</a>.  Up to three
    files may be entered by separating the names with a plus, +.
    If the time is set to FIRST or LAST, the first or last
    time from the first file will be used.

    The projection and area for the grid are read from the
    navigation block in the output grid file.  The extend grid
    area, the station spacing and the data subset area are read
    from the analysis block.  The extend area is used to define
    a larger grid for the first pass, allowing data to be
    interpolated back to stations outside the final grid area.
    The average station spacing is used to compute the weighting
    functions.  The data subset area specifies which data
    will be used in the analysis.  If <a href=../parm/dtaarea.html>DTAAREA</a> is blank or set
    to DATA, the data area defined in the analysis block will
    be used.  This is the recommended procedure.  However,
    <a href=../parm/dtaarea.html>DTAAREA</a> may be specified in the same way as the <a href=../parm/area.html>AREA</a>
    parameter used in other programs.  This is especially useful
    to eliminate stations which are known to have bad data.

    A first-guess field can be used in the analysis.  The name
    of the grid file containing the guess field must be entered
    in <a href=../parm/guess.html>GUESS</a>,  and the diagnostic functions that compute the
    first-guess grids must be entered in <a href=../parm/guesfun.html>GUESFUN</a>.  If a diagnostic
    function is not specified, the corresponding surface parameter
    will be used.  If the grid file contains the analysis time or
    has only one time, that time will be used;  otherwise, a
    forecast time that is valid at the analysis time will be computed
    based on user inputs.  Grid time, level, and vertical coordinate
    could also be inlined in diagnostic functions.  When a guess field
    is used, it is inserted into the grid as the zeroth pass.

    Each pass of the analysis interpolates data from stations to
    grid points using the weighting function:

		WTFUNC = EXP [ -DIST ** 2 / <a href=../parm/weight.html>WEIGHT</a> ]

    where:

	DIST ** 2 = [ ( lat (grid) - lat (stn) ) ** 2 +
		( lon (grid) - lon (stn) ) ** 2 * coslsq (grid) ]
	COSLSQ = COS ( lat (grid) ) ** 2
	<a href=../parm/weight.html>WEIGHT</a> = 5.051457 * ( <a href=../parm/deltan.html>DELTAN</a> * 2 / PI ) ** 2
	<a href=../parm/deltan.html>DELTAN</a> = Station spacing read from grid file analysis block

    Near the poles, an approximate calculation of the distance along
    a great circle arc is used.

    <a href=../parm/gamma.html>GAMMA</a>, the convergence parameter, multiplies the weights for
    passes after the first pass.  <a href=../parm/gamma.html>GAMMA</a> must be within the range
    0 - 1.  Any value outside this range will default to a value
    of .3.  If <a href=../parm/gamma.html>GAMMA</a> is 0, the number of passes will be set to 1.
    The recommended value for <a href=../parm/gamma.html>GAMMA</a> is .3.

    <a href=../parm/search.html>SEARCH</a> is used to control the search radius, which is the
    maximum distance that a station may be from a grid point to be
    used in the analysis for that point.  The search radius will be
    set so that stations whose weighting function would be less than
    EXP (-<a href=../parm/search.html>SEARCH</a>) will not be used.  <a href=../parm/search.html>SEARCH</a> must be in the range
    1 - 50.  If it is not, a default value of 20 will be used.  If
    a very small value is used, many grid points will not have 3
    stations within the search area and will be set to the missing
    data value.  Entering /EX after the <a href=../parm/search.html>SEARCH</a> value allows
    data extrapolation to assign values to grid points on the
    periphery of the data region.  This will reduce the number of
    grid points with missing values in data void regions.

    <a href=../parm/npass.html>NPASS</a> controls the number of passes.  Valid values are in the
    range 1 - 5.  Note that two passes are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.

    <a href=../parm/qcntl.html>QCNTL</a> is the quality control threshold values.  It is used only
    when the first-guess field exists.

    <a href=../parm/oabnd.html>OABND</a> specifies the bounds file(s) to use for 'blocking'. Multiple
    bound areas may be specified via '+' sign between bound names.
    The bounds could be either pre-defined bound area or VG files
    containing closed lines. The bound blocking results in:
    (1) all grid points inside of the blocking bounds will be marked
        as MISSED without objective analysis performed on them.
    (2) all stations inside of the bounds will not be used in analysis.
    (3) if the line segment between a grid point and a station
        intersects with the boundaries, that station will not be used
        in the analysis for that associated grid point.

    <a href=../parm/gdattim.html>GDATTIM</a> is a list of date/time to be written into the <a href=../parm/gdfile.html>GDFILE</a>.
    If it is blank, <a href=../parm/dattim.html>DATTIM</a> will be used. Only full GEMPAK times or
    forecast hours are allowed. For instance:
                050610/1200;050610/1800
                050610/1200F006
                F012;F018
    If <a href=../parm/gdattim.html>GDATTIM</a> is a forecast hour, <a href=../parm/dattim.html>DATTIM</a> will be added before the
    forecast hour.

    <a href=../parm/gfunc.html>GFUNC</a> is the scalar grid function. If it is blank, the surface
    parameter <a href=../parm/sfparm.html>SFPARM</a> will be used.

    <a href=../parm/glevel.html>GLEVEL</a> is the vertical level of the grid.

    <a href=../parm/gvcord.html>GVCORD</a> is the vertical coordinate of the grid.


EXAMPLES
 
    1.  Analyze 15Z temperature, dewpoint, wind components and
        mean sea level pressure in two surface files for the area
        of us-. The first-guess field is from the 3hr forecast of
        NGM.  The output grid is sfc.grd. If the difference between
        the original temperature and pressure data and the
	interpolated first-guess values is greater than 5 C and 10 mb,
        the original data will be discarded. The blocking bounds
	are specified as closed lines in florida.vgf.
