NMCSFC decodes surface synoptic data in NMC archive
format and writes it to a GEMPAK surface data file.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION                                                             
                                                                                
    NMCSFC decodes surface observations in NMC Office
    Note 29/124 format and writes it to the GEMPAK surface
    file given by SFFILE.  AREA is entered as the
    southwestern and northeastern corner points of the
    region over which stations will be included.

    The NMC raw file name is entered by specifying SFEFIL.
    The file may be either EBCIDC or ASCII data.

    NMCSFC will create an GEMPAK surface file if SFFILE
    does not already exist using TIMSTN to set the number
    of times and stations to included in the file.
