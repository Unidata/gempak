DCSHEF VERSION 2

The GEMPAK DCSHEF program decodes raw SHEF reports from a real-time 
data feed (via an LDM), or from a file containing raw SHEF reports.
The data is written to a GEMPAK surface file.  

The decoder is available in the file dcshef.tar.Z and includes:

Below, you will find a description of how the SHEF decoder works,
and instructions on how to install DCSHEF.  If you do not care how 
the decoder works, skip ahead to the installation steps.


I. How DCSHEF decodes SHEF Reports
----------------------------------


General:

The DCSHEF decoder will decode .A, .B, and .E SHEF reports. Data
from different report types are stored together in the same output
GEMPAK surface file.  DCSHEF does not distinguish between data 
decoded from .A, .B, or .E reports.  

When you configure DCSHEF to decode data, you have complete control
over which stations are decoded, and what parameters are decoded.
You can run multiple copies of DCSHEF, decoding different sets
of parameters for different stations, as long as each configuration
of DCSHEF has its own GEMPAK output file.  You may not write to the
same GEMPAK output file from separate instances of DCSHEF.  See the
installation steps below for more details.


Time:

All times in SHEF reports are converted to and stored in UTC time in
the GEMPAK output file.  Often, SHEF data is reported in local time.
But, since there is no way to indicate the time zone in a GEMPAK data
file, all times are converted to UTC.  The only exception is the 
special time of 2400.  In SHEF reports, 2400 is used to indicate the 
end of a given time period.  For example, it may mean the end of a day
or the end of a month.  When DCSHEF encounters the time 2400, the time 
is not converted to UTC time.  Instead, the date time string 
YYMMDD/2400 is assigned to the data.

For .A & .B reports, the report time is rounded to the hour using
the standard GEMPAK rounding rule.  That is, when the report time
is greater than or equal to 45 minutes after the hour, the valid
time is rounded to the next hour.  When the report time is less
than 45 minutes after the hour, the valid time is rounded down
to the current hour.  The actual report time is always available
in the special GEMPAK parameter STIM.  STIM can be accessed like
any other data parameter, even though it is not listed in the
parameter packing file.

For .E reports, the report time is rounded up to the nearest 15 
minute interval.  Thus, valid times will be HH00, HH15, HH30,
or HH45.  For .E reports with increments less than 15 minutes, 
data is stored only when the valid time is unique.  Thus, for
a report containing data every 5 minutes, only the data at HH00,
HH05, HH20, HH35, and HH50 are stored at HH00, HH15, HH30, HH45 
and (HH+1)00, respectively.  Again, the actual report time for
each stored report is always available in the STIM variable.


Parameters:

DCSHEF will decode any valid SHEF parameter.  SHEF parameters can
be up to 7 characters long, although usually they are only 2 or
3 characters long.  The file $GEMTBL/pack/SHEFparms.txt contains
text versions of Tables 1-4 from the SHEF Users Guide.
(https://hsp.nws.noaa.gov/hrl/shef/contents.htm).  These tables 
list the available codes used to create the parameters names.
You can also look at some raw SHEF reports to see examples of
the parameter names.

DCSHEF will allow you to decode any of these parameters simply by 
listing the parameter name in a GEMPAK parameter packing file.  
For best results, you should use 4 characters to define a parameter
in the GEMPAK parameter packing file.  If you use fewer than 4 
characters, DCSHEF will expand the parameter name to 4 characters 
using the default values for character 3 and 4 ("I" and "R", 
respectively).  DCSHEF will expand the parameter names both in 
the packing table and in the data, so that all the appropriate 
data is decoded.  However, if you use fewer than 4 characters,
you will not be able to use any of the mathematical functions
on these data.  Therefore, I suggest that you expand all 2 and
3 character parameter names to four characters by using the
default values of "I" and "R" for characters 3 and 4, respectively.

In the SOO distribution of NAWIPS/DCSHEF, up to 40 parameters may 
be listed in a single parameter packing file.  If you want to 
decode more than 40 SHEF parameters, you will have to create a 
second packing table, and run two copies of the DCSHEF decoder
from two entries in the LDM pattern action file.  Note that each 
packing table requires it's own output GEMPAK data file, so you 
will have to store the data in separate GEMPAK files.  Here's an 
example: In shef.pack, I list some standard parameters like temps, 
press, precip, and wind data.  I decode this data into the files 
YYMMDD_shef.gem.  In addition, I create a second packing table 
called shefriver.pack where I list river information such as stage 
heights, gate openings, fish counts, water quality, and discharge 
information.  I decode this data into the files YYMMDD_river.gem.

You can change the parameters to decode at any time, by changing
the parameter packing file. However, note that changes only take
affect when the GEMPAK data file is created.  That is usually at
the start of a new day.

Finally, note that SHEF parameter names can use up to 7 characters.
DCSHEF nor GEMPAK can distinguish between the SHEF parameter names 
that differ in the 5th, 6th, or 7th character.  Thus, if a single
report contains data for two different parameters whose names 
differ only in characters 5-7, DCSHEF will decode only one of 
those data.  Usually, this situation does not occur.


Stations:

There are 10s of thousands of stations in the US reporting data
in SHEF.  The SOO distribution of NAWIPS & DCSHEF will only support
up to 4700 stations per GEMPAK data file.  Therefore, you will
have to choose your favorite 4700 (or fewer) stations to decode.

The file $GEMTBL/stns/shefstns.tbl.master contains a list of 
stations (ordered by state) which report precipitation data.
This is the most complete list of stations I have been able to
find.  You can start by selecting the stations of interest to
you from this master station list.  Note, however that the 
shefstns.tbl.master file may not be complete, and you may need
to supplement this table with stations of your own.

If you must decode SHEF reports from more than 4700 stations, 
you will have to create two station tables, and run two copies 
of the DCSHEF decoder from two entries in the LDM pattern action
file.  Again, you must use separate file names for each copy of 
DCSHEF.  For example, I may put all the stations reporting SHEF 
data from Colorado in shefstnsco.tbl and decode that data into 
YYMMDD_shefco.gem.  And, I may put all the stations reporting 
SHEF data from Wyoming in shefstnswy.tbl and decode the data 
into YYMMDD_shefwy.gem.

Finally, there are some HADS stations that are not in the 
shefstns.tbl.master file.  You may want to check the HADS list
at https://hsp.nws.noaa.gov/oh/hads/hsas/hsas.htm, and add any
stations of interest to your shefstns.tbl file.  Simply follow
the existing format shown in shefstns.tbl.master.


Units:

SHEF data is stored in the output GEMPAK data file in English units.
These units are the default for SHEF data, and are listed with the 
parameter names in Table 1 of the SHEF Users Guide and in the file
$GEMTBL/pack/SHEFparms.txt.   If the units function "DUS" is used 
in a SHEF report, that means the data values are reported in S.I.
units.  DCSHEF will then convert the data values from S.I. units 
into English units and store them in the output GEMPAK data file.


Data:

Once the SHEF data is decoded into an output GEMPAK data file, you
can view the data using any surface data plotting program.  You
can create maps using SFMAP.  You can create meteograms using
SFGRAM.  You can even do an objective analysis on the data using
OABSFC to create gridded data.  (Be sure that the available SHEF
data provides enough spatial coverage so that the objective 
analysis is valid.)  You can list the SHEF data using the SFLIST
program.

SHEF data can also be viewed in GARP.  To configure GARP to view
SHEF data, you must add a few keys to the 
$NAWIPS/garp/config/Garp_defaults file.  For example:

  sfc_keys : "surf,shb,shef"
  sfc_labels : "Hourly/METAR,Ship/Buoy,SHEF"
  sfc_tables : "sfcparms.lst,shbparms.lst,shefparms.lst"
  shef_dir : $METDAT/gempak/shef
  shef_parms: ";TAIR;TADR;TNIR;TXIR;PPPR;PPQR;STIM"

Your "shef_parms" list will contain those data you routinely want
plotted in GARP.  You should put your complete list of SHEF parameters
(from your shef.pack file) in a $NAWIPS/garp/tables/shefparms.lst file.
(You can use the $NAWIPS/garp/tables/sfcparms.lst file as a sample.)


Performance:

DCSHEF is a standard GEMPAK decoder.  It does quite a bit of string
manipulation, and like other GEMPAK decoders, can be a little slow
at times.  In the case of METAR or upper air decoding, this is not
a big deal.  However, because of the overwhelming volume of data in
SHEF, this can become an issue.  

For most SOOs, who only receive reports from a few states, the 
performance of DCSHEF will be fine.  However, if your office receives
SHEF data from the entire country, you may run into slow decoding.
For example, it took over 20 minutes to decode all the 12Z SHEF data
on the NWS DD+ data feed. (The DD+ data feed includes most of the 
reports from the entire US.) 

If you see slow decoding of the SHEF data, you might consider 
restricting the amount of data sent to DCSHEF by modifying the
pattern in your pqact.conf file.  For example, you might change
the (...)(RR.) pattern to (NMC|SEA)RR(M|A|S).


Command line options:

DCSHEF uses a number of command line options.  They are:

    -v N   Set the verbosity level to "N".  As N goes up, more verbose
           logging occurs.  The default is "0".  Level 1 will report
           stations not decoded.  Level 2 will report stations & 
           parameters not decoded.  Levels 3, 4, & 5 will include
           Level 1 & 2 messages, along with additional debugging
           messages.

    -c curtim  "curtim" is the pseudo-current time.  This is a complete
               GEMPAK format date/time (YYMMDD/HHMM) and is used as the 
               system time when decoding archive data.  The default value 
               for this variable is the system time.

    -b nhours  "nhours" is the number of hours prior to the current time.
               Only reports within this time period are decoded into 
               the data file.  The default value for this variable is
               24 hours.

    -d decoder_log  "decoder_log" is the name and path of the decoder
                    log file.  The default value is dcshef.log

    -t time_out  "time_out" is the time-out value in seconds for the 
                 decoder.  If no data is received within the specified
                 time limit, the program will exit.  The default time-
                 out value is 600 seconds.

    -h         Print the usage statement and exit

    -p prmfil  Set the parameter packing table to "prmfil".  The default
               value is $GEMTBL/pack/shef.pack.

    -s stntbl  Set the station table to "stntbl".  The default value
               is $GEMTBL/stns/shefstns.tbl.

    -a iadstn  Define the maximum number of additional stations (beyond
               those in the station table specified in "-s stntbl") that 
               can be added to the data file as "iadstn".  The default 
               value is 0.

    -m maxtim  Set the maximum number of times in a single data file
               to "maxtim". The default value is 100. 

    -g gemtbldir  Set the path to the GEMPAK tables ($GEMTBL).  This 
                  is required when running the decoder from the LDM.
                  This definition can also be used for the parameter
                  table and station table entries.


Limitations:

DCSHEF will decode most SHEF reports.  There are a few exceptions:

1) .E reports with time increments of less than 15 minutes will
only decode those data values at unique valid times.  (See the "Times"
section for more details.)

2) In the same report, parameter names that differ only in the 5-7th
character are not distinguishable.

3) More than one date override function in the data or header section 
of .B reports can not be handled.

4) Data qualifier (DQ groups), duration information (DV groups), and
creation date information (DC groups) are not decoded.

II. Usage Guide
----------------------

1) Set up the list of parameters to decode in the parameter
packing file.  A sample packing file is included in the 
distribution in the file $GEMTBL/pack/shef.pack.  You will
find the complete list of valid SHEF parameters in the file
$GEMTBL/pack/SHEFparm.txt, or in the on-line version of
the SHEF Users Guide:
   https://hsp.nws.noaa.gov/hrl/shef/contents.htm
See the "Parameters" section above for more information.

2) Set up a list of stations to decode in the station table
file.  A master list of stations is included in the 
distribution in the file $GEMTBL/stns/shefstns.tbl.master.
You can copy up to 4700 stations into your station table.
(default name $GEMTBL/stns/shefstns.tbl)  See the "Stations"
section above for more information.

3) Configure the pattern action file, pqact.conf, of your LDM
to run DCSHEF upon receipt of a SHEF report.  Here is an
example entry (watch the TABS):

    AFOS  ^(...)RR.(..)
	PIPE	dcshef -v 0 
        -d /metdat/gempak/shef/dcshef.log 
	-g /usr1/nawips/gempak/tables 
        -p shef.pack 
	-s shefstns.tbl 
        /metdat/gempak/shef/YYMMDD_shef.gem
