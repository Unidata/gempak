                                 DATA SELECT


This pop-up selects text products for display.  Pressing the right mouse 
button when the cursor is in the map area will toggle the pop-up on and off.  
It may also be invoked by clicking "Data" on the NWX display panel.  To 
display a product:

1.   Click on a product category from the "Select Data Type Group" section 
     and a list of available products given that product category will 
     appear in the "Select Data Type Product" section.

2.   Click on a product in the "Select Data Type Product" section.  Station 
     markers (appear as red boxes) are plotted on the map if multiple 
     stations issue the product.  Products that are not available are 
     indicated with an asterisk.

3.   If station markers are plotted on the map, click on the marker closest 
     to the desired station to display its product in the "text report" window.

To view earlier versions of the selected product, click on "Previous" in the 
"text report" window.  To then step ahead and return to the current product, 
click "Next."

Click on the "Hours Covered" radio buttons to limit the search to products 
from the current time back to the selected number of hours.
