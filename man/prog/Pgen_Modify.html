			Modify Action


I.  Functionality

The modify action changes the shape of a drawn line.  It may either replace the
interior portion of a line, replace a portion of a line by retaining all 
line vertices up to a selected point on a line and replacing all remaining 
vertices, or totally replace the original line with a new line. 
Line, front and Sigmet objects may be modified.  A ghost line is drawn while 
modifying a line indicating the resultant line. 

II. Operation 

The portion of the line that is modified is determined by the location of
the first mouse click relative to the line, the direction of subsequent 
clicked points relative to the first, and the location of the last clicked 
point relative to the line.  A tie distance, currently set at 10 pixels, 
is used to control the modify function behavior.  The following describes how
open and closed lines can be modified.  For each case, click the Modify action
from the Product Generation Palette.  Move the cursor and click the left 
mouse button to select the desired line to be modified.

A.  Total Replacement of Open and Closed Lines

Place the cursor at a distance greater than the tie distance away from the line 
and click the left mouse button.  Subsequent left mouse clicks will add new 
line vertices completely replacing the original line.  The ghost line indicates
the shape of the new line.  Click the middle mouse to terminate the new line.  
Click the middle mouse button again to deselect the line. 

B.  Interior Replacement of Open and Closed Lines

Place the cursor within the tie distance of the line and click the left mouse
button.  Subsequent left mouse clicks will add points to the line.  The ghost
line indicates the shape of the modified line as points are added.  For open
lines, the last added point must be placed within the tie distance of the 
original line to complete the interior replacement.  If the cursor is outside
the tie distance, then partial replacement is performed.  Click the middle mouse 
button to end the interior line replacement.  Click the middle mouse button 
again to de-select the line.

C.  Partial Replacement of Open Lines

Partial replacement is performed in the same manner as interior replacement
as described above.  The only difference is that the last added point is 
located greater than the tie distance away from the original line.

III.  Rules

A.  Line Portion Replaced For Interior and Partial Line Modifications

The portion of the line that is replaced is determined by the modify direction.
The modify direction is defined to be the direction relative to the normal
of the first added point and the original line.   For example, if the cursor
is moved to the right of the normal line, then all line vertices to the
left of the normal are retained and all points to the right of the normal are
replaced by new points added by clicking the left mouse button.  The ghost
line highlights which portion of the original line is retained and shows
the shape of the new line as points are added.   

B.  Vertex Addition in the Vicinity of Existing Vertices

If the first clicked point or the last clicked point is within the tie
distance of an existing vertex, the existing vertex is used for the new
line instead of having two vertices nearly co-located.  This check is
not performed for intermediate clicked points.
