                                BIN HOURS
		
Time binning of observational data has been added to NMAP.  The data types 
that are available for time binning are: surface (SFC), surface-forecast (SFF),
upper air observations (SND) or upper air forecast (SNF).  For all other 
data types, the time binning button is insensitive to any action on it.


The datatype table $GEMPAK/tables/config/datatype.tbl contains the BIN HOURS 
in the ninth column. The entry is given as, T/BH:BM/AH:AM/M, where:
                        T     - time binning 'ON' or 'OFF'
                        BH:BM - hours:minutes before current time
                        AH:HM - hours:minutes after current time
			M     - only most recent flag 'ON' or 'OFF'
The left most entry T for BIN HOURS is whether time binning is on or off by 
default.  The next subfield BH:BM represents the number of hours:minutes
'before' the current time to include in the binning.  The next subfield
gives the number of hours:minutes 'after' the current time to use in the
binning. Both the before and after bin hours:minutes are positive numbers.
The last subfield M is a flag indicating whether only the most recent data is
to be plotted.

The 'Data Selection Window' in NMAP has a new button 'Bin Source' and a check 
box to the left of this button.  If a data type is one of the four listed 
above, the check box is active even though the 'Bin Source' button is 
insensitive. When the check box is checked, the 'Bin Source' button is made 
sensitive.  Selecting this button pops up a new GUI, 'Source Bin' and the 
user may change the number of hours and minutes before the current time to
display on a single frame and the number of hours and minutes after the
current time (provided data is available) to display on the current frame. 
The default setting for the text values are retrieved from the datatype.tbl 
and the time before and time after values are displayed in their respective 
text boxes in the GUI. The user may then edit the hours and minutes displayed
in the text boxes.  There are also 4 buttons at the bottom of this GUI. Their
actions are:

    a) If there are no changes to the text boxes:
        i. 'Accept' - The current values in the before and after values are 
            not changed
       ii. 'Default' - The default values for Hours/Minutes Before and
	   Hours/Minutes After are read  from the datatype.tbl. 
      iii. 'Cancel' -  The Hours and Minutes Before and Hours and Minutes
	    After values from when the pop up first came up are used. Any
	    changes made are ignored. 
       iv. 'Help' - The help file for Bin Source is brought up.

    b) If there are changes to the text boxes:
        i. 'Accept' - The new before and after values are used.
       ii. 'Default' - The default values for Hours/Minutes Before and
	   Hours/Minutes After are read from the datatype.tbl. 
      iii. 'Cancel' - The previous before and after values are restored. 
       iv. 'Help' - The help file for Bin Source is brought up.


Finally, the values for the time binning on/off flag, most recent only flag,
hours/minutes to bin before and after the current time may be saved to an SP
file.  The new SPF data attribute line looks like:
	'<loop1_source1_timbin>	T/BH:BM/AH:AM/M', 

where:
     T     - time binning 'ON' or 'OFF'
     BH:BM - hours:minutes before current time
     AH:AM - hours:minutes after current time
     M	   - only most recent flag 'ON' or 'OFF'
