SHPSSF
                                                                       
  SHPSSF converts map file(s) from the Shapefile format to the Sequential 
  Standard Format (SSF).

SYNOPSIS

  shpssf [options] shape_filename1[shape_filename2[shape_filename3]]

DESCRIPTION

  SHPSSF is a generic program that converts map file(s) from the Shapefile 
  format to the Sequential Standard Format (SSF). The output map file in 
  SSF format can be directly input into program SSFGSF to create a map file
  in GEMPAK Standard Format (GSF).

  The output map file can have different resolutions, and at least one
  resolution has to be given. The resolution is specified in the program 
  options. Upto three map files in the Shapefile format can be combined
  together to create one map file in SSF format.

OPTIONS
  -s  strip_tolerance
      Strip overlapped map lines. Suggested tolerance is 0.005. If gaps
      appear, decrease the value.

  -t  map_filename
      Create top resolution map file.

  -i  map_filename
      Create high resolution map file.

  -m  map_filename
      Create medium resolution map file.

  -l  map_filename
      Create low resolution map file.

  -a  map_filename
      Create all resolution map files. 'tp', 'hi', 'me' and 'lo' will prefix
      map_filename to indicate top, high, medium and low resolution respectively.

  -h  Display this help.

EXAMPLE

  shpssf -s 0.005 -i hicnus.ssf c_18nv03

	the program creates high resolution map files from the shapefile 
	c_18nv03. The strip tolerance is 0.005.

  shpssf -a mzcn.ssf c_18nv03 mz15jl04

	the program combines shapefile c_18nv03 and mz15jl04 together, and
	creates top, high, medium and low resolution map files with file name
	tpmzcn.ssf, himzcn.ssf, memzcn.ssf and lomzcn.ssf respectively.
	Overlapped map lines are not stripped.
