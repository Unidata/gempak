                                    ZOOM


"Zoom" enlarges a geographic region.

To begin the zoom, click the "Zoom" button; the button turns red and the mouse 
pointer changes to a cross-hair.  Next, specify the zoom area by rubber-banding 
a box around the desired region:  move the mouse so that the pointer starts in 
one corner of the area, hold down the left mouse button, and drag to the 
opposite corner of the region.  After the left mouse button is released, the 
enlarged graphic or image sequence is re-loaded.

Zoom can be used with the pull-down option menu.  When the "Extended Zoom" is 
ON (default), re-load attempts to fill the entire display area.  When the 
"Extended Zoom" is OFF, the display area is defined by the selected lat/lon 
corners.

To cancel a zoom before an area is zoomed in (when the "Zoom" button is red), 
click anywhere on the display area.  If you have already started to rubber-band,
reduce the region so as to rubber-band a very small rectangle.
