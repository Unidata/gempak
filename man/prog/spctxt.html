SPCTXT

    SPCTXT creates the text aviation product, county list product,
    the public product, the watch coordination list product, the 
    watch outline update - initial, the aviation watch notification
    and the public watch notification.  If specified on the command 
    line, cancel watch products are created for the SAW and SEL products.

    The input to the program is the ww####.txt file that is 
    created by an issued watch within product generation in NMAP.
    The output text files, WW####.SAW, WW####.SEL, WW####.SEV,
    WW####.WCL, WW####.WOU, WW####.AWN, WW####.PWN, WW####.SAW.CNL 
    and WW####.SEL.CNL are created in the directory where the program 
    is called.
    
    If replacement watches are listed in the current ww####.txt file,
    those files need to exist in the same directory where SPCTXT is 
    called.

    The user will be prompted for the watch number(s) of any continuing 
    watches when the SEL and PWN products are being created.  The numbers
    should be entered on one line separated by spaces.

    The output text products which may need modifications by the user:

        SAW - WWUS30 - There should not be any modification necessary.

        SEL - WWUS20 - The user will need to add the general description 
              of the region within the state(s) where the watch is
              occurring and the DISCUSSION text. 

        SEV - WWUS50 - There should not be any modification necessary.

	WCL - WWUS51 - There should not be any modification necessary.

	WOU - WWUS52 - There should not be any modification necessary.

	AWN - WWUS40 - There should not be any modification necessary.

        PWN - WWUS09 - The user will need to add the general description 
              of the region within the state(s) where the watch is
              occurring and the DISCUSSION text. 


    To create the SEV, SEL, SAW, WCL, WOU, AWN and PWN products: 
    
        spctxt ww####.txt 

    To create a canceled SAW and SEL products:    
 
        spctxt ww####.txt  cancel

    If the ww####.txt file does not exist or if the filename was
    not entered on the command line, the program will exit.
