                                   SEEK

I. Summary

The seek function calculates the distance and direction between two 
user selected points or stations from a GEMPAK station table.  The
function also draws a ghost marker for each selected point and a ghost line 
connecting them.  The markers and line are erased and redrawn each time 
new points are selected.  They are erased upon exiting the function. 
Click the seek icon (small map with an arrow) to the right of the "RELOAD" 
icon to invoke the seek function.  

After the seek icon is clicked, the "Seek Results" GUI is activated.  This GUI
controls how locations are entered and how the resultant distances and 
directions are displayed.  Click the "Take Control" button to gain cursor
control if product generation is active.  Click the "Close" button to exit
the seek function.

II. Entering End Points

The text and buttons to the right of the buttons labeled "1" and "2" control
the input of each end point.  Click the numbered button to input the desired
location for that end point.  Click the middle button to select the desired
station table, e.g., "CITIES".  Type in the desired location in the text 
box immediately to the right of the number button.  When typing a station 
name, a scroll list appears at the bottom of the "Seek Results" GUI with a 
list of matching locations as each character of the station name is entered.  
The location may be selected by clicking on the desired choice in the scroll 
list.  Select "LATLON" to enter the latitude and longitude of an end point.
The values may be entered as degrees and decimal or in degrees and minutes
where the minute value follows the ":" delimiter.

Alternatively, an end point can be selected by positioning the cursor.  Click 
the "Click Point" button and move the cursor to the desired location and click 
the left mouse button.  The latitude and longitude or nearest station is then
entered for that end point.

III. Distance and Direction Display Options

The distance and direction between the end points are displayed in the 
text box below the end point buttons.  Click the icon with the opposing
horizontal arrows to reverse the direction between the end points.

The seek function also lists the nearest set of stations to the selected
end point in a scroll list at the top of the "Seek Results" GUI.  The 
end point is selected by clicking on button "1" or button "2".  The scroll
list includes the station name, latitude and longitude, and distance and
direction.  The "Limit:" arrows below the scroll list control the number of 
nearest stations displayed in the scroll list. 

The "Dist Units" and "Dir Units" pop-ups control the units for the
distance and direction displays, respectively.

IV. Varying Distance and Direction Option

The seek function allows distance and direction to be displayed from 
a fixed point as the cursor is moved.  Press the left mouse button with
the cursor positioned on the desired location and then drag the mouse.  
A ghost line is drawn and the distance and direction are displayed from the
selected point as the cursor is moved.  The units are specified by the
"Dist Units" and "Dir Units" pop-ups in the "Seek Results" GUI.  

V.  Station Data Set Access

The seek function can operate on any valid GEMPAK station table.  These
tables are specified in the $GEMTBL/config/clo.tbl and $GEMTBL/nmap/seek.tbl
tables.  See these tables for additional details.
