			 	WIPE

The wipe function clears all displayed data for the currently viewed loop.
Click the icon with the hand symbol located on the top left hand side of the
main NMAP GUI to invoke wipe.  A confirmation window is invoked to allow the
cancellation of the wipe command.

The wipe function only deletes data sets associated with the currently viewed
loop.  Data sets loaded in other loops are not affected.  Product generation
graphics are also not affected by the wipe function.  If image data are
part of the displayed loop, then the wipe function re-sets the geographic
area to the default after clearing the frames.  Otherwise, the geographic
area defined for the loop is retained after clearing the frames.
