TESTGPC
                                                                       
  TESTGPC tests the GPC (General Polygon Clipper) library.

  The complete documentation of the GPC library is located in the postscript file
  $NAWIPS/doc/gpclib/gpc.ps.

  Please note the following terminology:
  The GPC library refers to 'contours' which are normally thought of as
  'polygons'. As such, the GPC library extends the meaning of 'polygon' 
  to be a set of 'contours'.


INPUT FILE DESCRIPTIONS

  In order to test the GPC, polygons and/or sets of vertices must be input
  from external files. (Or in the case of vertices, they may be typed in.)

  The two file formats are as follows:

  1) GPC LIBRARY POLYGON FILES

  A GPC polygon is stored in an ASCII file using the format:

    <num-contours>
    <num-vertices-in-first-contour>
    [<first-contour-hole-flag>]
    <vertex-list>
    <num-vertices-in-second-contour>
    [<second-contour-hole-flag>]
    <vertex-list>
    etc...

  The hole-flag values are optional, their reading and writing being controlled 
  by setting the second argument of gpc_read_polygon() and gpc_write_polygon() 
  to 1 (TRUE) or 0 (FALSE). Clip operations will correctly set the contour hole 
  flags of the result polygon. This information may be ignored by the user 
  application if it is not required.


  For example, a single polygon consisting of a triangular hole within a 
  quadrilateral (with hole flags included) may take the form:

          2
          3
          1
            4.0   4.0
            6.0   5.0
            5.0   6.0
          4
          0
            2.0   1.0
            8.0   2.0
            7.0   9.0
            1.0   7.0


  2) TESTGPC VERTEX FILES

  This file format is provided for the GPC test program only. The file consists
  of a simple list of coordinate pairs separated by whitespace only.

  For example, a triangle would be represented in the file as:

    0 0
    1 0
    1 1

  The number of points in the vertext list is NOT included in the file. Rather
  it is computed when the points are read in.
