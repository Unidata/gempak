                     POINT FORECAST SOUNDINGS


The POINT FORECAST SOUNDING SELECTION window allows the user to plot 
forecast soundings stored in GEMPAK upper air format data files. The
data set choices are defined in $NAWIPS/tables/nsharp/nsharp_pfc.tbl,
and reference the datatype.tbl template/aliases. Any GEMPAK upper air 
file may be used by choosing the "BROWSE" option in the file list. 

Typical sources of point forecast soundings include buffer
encoded model output soundings which may be decoded into GEMPAK format 
upper air files using NAMSND. PFC sounding files typically contain 
forecast times, therefore the same validation time may exist in multiple
sounding files.

After selecting the GEMPAK PFC data set, the available data files
are displayed. A single file, or multiple files may be chosen.
Multiple files are selected by clicking a starting file and dragging 
the mouse pointer, or by selecting the first file and then depressing 
<SHIFT> while selecting the second time. Individual files may be added by 
depressing <CTRL> when selecting additional files.

After selecting from the available files, the times within the selected
files will be displayed in the "Sounding times" list. A single time, or 
multiple times may be selected (similarly as described above). After 
selecting the desired times from the available times list, the sounding 
location is selected using the available stations displayed on the selection map. 
The location for which the soundings are computed is obtained by positioning 
the mouse pointer over the desired point and clicking mouse button 1. 

The map AREA may be set using the predefined map regions, while
ZOOMing is accomplished through the use of a rubber band box.
UNZOOMing will restore the image to the current AREA.

Select "Cancel" to close the sounding selection window without changing the 
current sounding display. The sounding selection window will close after a 
sounding location is chosen from the map display.
