MDPSPC

  MDPSPC generates a text file with lat-lon points from an enclosed area (line),
  the list of WFOs in or touching the enclosed area as well as two letter state
  abbreviations from a VGF file. This program is for the Mesoscale Discussion 
  Product (MCD).

INPUT PARAMETERS

  mdpspc vgf_filename

  mdpspc	Program name
  vgf_filename	VGF file containing line element

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

  MDPSPC scans a VGF file and generates a set of lat-lon points from a single line.
  The lat-lon points are in the format "%04d%04d". Latitudes are multiplied by
  100 and have G_NINT applied; longitudes have 100 subtracted from their value
  if their value exceeds 100, then are multiplied by 100 and have G_NINT applied.
  Only six pairings are listed per output text file line.  A list of WFOs touched or
  inside the enclosed area is also included as well as the two letter state
  abbreviations

EXAMPLE

  If the VGF file 'testfile.vgf' contained a line with the following points:
32.11  88.41 
32.27  86.30 
31.79  83.20 
31.31  81.93 
30.11  81.77 
29.79  83.61
29.92  85.51 
30.21  88.22 

  Then the output file 'testfile.mdp' would contain:
STATES=FL GA AL 

ATTN...WFO...JAX...FFC...TAE...BMX...MOB...
