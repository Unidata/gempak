                              NMAP2 DATA SELECTION 


I. Summary

The "Data Selection Window" selects and loads data sets into loops.  Multiple 
data sets can be loaded into a loop, except for the case of images where 
only one image data source can be selected for a given loop.  The 
"Data Selection" window also specifies several display attributes including
roam factor, station plotting model, and auto-update on/off options.  In 
addition, a time line is shown in the window that allows the control of which 
times appear in the loop.  Data set selection can be automated by clicking
the "Restore Data Settings" button which loads pre-defined data sets using
Stored Procedure Files (SPFs).  Selected data sets may be saved to an SPF for 
future use by clicking the "Save Data Settings" button.  See help on 
"Procedures" for additional information.  Clicking the "Map" icon allows the 
selection of the geographic area and map overlay attributes.  See the 
"Map-Selection" help for additional information.  

Click the "Data" icon in the main NMAP window or press the right mouse button 
to invoke the "Data Selection" window.  Clicking the "Load" button at the bottom 
of the window loads the selected data sets for all loops that have data sets
specified.  After loading, the most recent frame in the loop is shown except 
in the case of model data, where the earliest forecast time is shown.

II. "New Source" - Adding Data Sets to a Loop 

Click the "New Source" button to add a data set to a loop.  This 
button invokes the "Data Source" window which allows the choice of the type
of data set to display, e.g., METAR, and the way the data is to be displayed,
e.g, station model.  Choices are presented for each data category through the
use of layered scroll lists.  The window vertically expands as desired choices
for each data category are selected from the scroll list.  The number of scroll 
list layers and their contents are a function of the type of data source, 
e.g., image, observational, model.  See the "Data Access-Configuration" help 
for a description of how each data source uses tables to define the list of 
items that appear in the scroll lists.  

Click the "Accept" button at the bottom of the "Data Source" window to add the 
desired data set to the loop display list.  The selected data set name appears 
in the "Data Source" pop-up.  Additional data sets are added to the display list 
by re-clicking the "New Source" button and selecting desired data set and 
display options from the scroll lists.  Data set names are added to the 
"Data Source" pop up as they are selected.  Note that previous selections for 
a particular data type, e.g., image, are "remembered" by the window to 
facilitate data set selection. 

Click the "Loop" button to select another loop for data selection.  Once data
sets for all loops are specified, click the "Load" button to load all the
selected data sets into their corresponding loops.

III. Time Line

The time line controls the time range, frame times and number of frames 
that appear in a loop.  The time line and its controls appear in the bottom half 
of the "Data Selection Window" surrounded by the black rectangular outline.

The loop frame times are determined by the data set that appears in the
"Dominant Source" pop-up.  The nominal times obtained from the dominant data set 
are shown as blue tick marks on the time line.  The red tick marks indicate 
which frames are currently selected.  By default, the most recent times are 
selected. For model data, all available forecast times are selected. 

All data sets selected for a loop are time-matched to the dominant data source's 
nominal times.  The time matching is conducted by selecting the nearest time
to the dominant data set time for each frame.   For example, if METAR data is 
the dominant data source, the time line will show hourly frame times.  In this 
case, if GOES East images are included in the loop, the GOES image that comes
closest to the hour is selected for each frame.  Alternatively, if the dominant 
data source is changed to the GOES East image data source, the time line will 
show frame times matched with the temporal increment of GOES imagery.  In this 
case the METAR data will be time-matched to the GOES imagery by finding the 
METAR time closest to the GOES image time for each frame.  By default, the first 
data set selected for a loop is the dominant source.  The dominant source may 
be changed by clicking on the "Dominant Source" pop-up and selecting another 
data set from the display list.

By default, the time range is referenced to the current time defined as the 
time that the NMAP program was started.  To update the current time to "now," 
click on the "Current Time" radio button.  This causes the most recently 
received data to become available for loading.  Alternately, click on the 
"Set Time" radio button to define a time range for data sets older than what
appears on the time line.  A set of date and time buttons appears.  Click on 
any part of the date and time buttons to set the desired reference time.  The
reference time is the most recent time shown on the time line.

The time range, number of frames and increment can be modified in a 
number of ways. The number of frames can be changed by moving the "Frames" 
slider bar.  Alternatively, the black box surrounding the selected frames can be 
stretched or shrunk by grabbing the end of the box with a left mouse click 
and dragging the mouse.  The time range can be moved by selecting the box away 
from the ends and dragging it to the desired position on the time line. The
time increment can be changed by clicking on the "Skip" up/down arrows.  
Specific frames may be selected on (red) or off (blue) for display by clicking 
them on or off on the time line.

The default time span, time increment, and number of frames selected are 
obtained in part from the table $GEMTBL/config/datatype.tbl.  See the 
"Data Access-Configuration" help to learn how the time line can be configured
for different data types.  Note that the maximum number of frames that can 
appear in the time line is 80.

The "Single Time" button allows a loop to be loaded with different grid products
valid at the same time. This capability allows various forecast products from a 
model or different models to be loaded into a frame sequence.  Each grid product 
is loaded into a separate frame in the loop.  Other data types, e.g., image or 
observational data, are time-matched and overlaid on each grid product.  To 
select a grid time for grid product matching, click the "Single Time" button 
and select the desired time from the time line.  A gridded data set must be 
dominant to enable the single time mode.

IV. "Modify" - Replacing a Data Set

Click the "Modify" button to replace the data set that appears in the
"Data Source" pop-up with another data set.  The "Data Source" window is
invoked with the selected data set highlighted.  Change the data source by
selecting different categories in the window scroll lists.  Click the
"Accept" button to replace the original data set with the new one.

V. "Edit Source" - Editing Data Set Display Attributes

Clicking the "Edit Source" button allows the modification of display attributes
for the data set listed in the "Data Source" button.  Display attribute 
modification is a function of data category.

    A. Surface(SURF_OBS), Upper-Air(UAIR_OBS), Surface Forecast(SURF_FCST) 

    Clicking the "Edit Source" button invokes a "Parm Edit" GUI that allows 
    modification of the station display density and plotting model.  Adjust the 
    the station display density by dragging the  "Filter"  slider bar.  Higher
    values of the filter parameter correspond to lower density data displays.
    Click the station model icon in the center of the GUI to invoke the "Station
    Model Edit" GUI.  This GUI allows the modification of text attributes, 
    parameter colors, and whether parameters are displayed.  Also, additional
    parameters may be added or substituted by selecting them from the "Parameter
    List" scroll list.  Click the desired station model position and then click
    the desired parameter.  The list of available parameters in the "Parameter
    List" scroll list is a function of the type of data being edited, e.g., 
    METAR, SYNOP, etc.  Each data type's parameters are obtained from a table in 
    $GEMTBL/nmap with the name of the data type concatenated with "_parms.tbl".
    For example the parameter list tables for METAR and SYNOP are
    metar_parms.tbl and synop_parms.tbl, respectively.  See these tables for
    additional information.

    B.  Miscellaneous (MISC) and VGF Data Types

    The types of attributes that can be modified vary for each data type because
    the display characteristics are quite different among the types.  Therefore, 
    clicking on the "Edit Source" button invokes a unique GUI for each data
    type with data set specific attributes to edit.  The default attributes
    for each data type are specified in the table $GEMTBL/config/miscset.tbl.
    See that table for additional information.


VI.  "Clear Source" - Deleting A Data Set Selection

A data set can be deleted from the display list and thus not loaded by
clicking the "Clear Source" button.  Select the data set to be deleted by
clicking on the "Data Source" button and choosing data set name.  If the
deleted data set is the dominant one, the next data source listed in
the "Data Source" pop up becomes dominant.

VII. "Turn Source On/Off" -  Toggling a Data Set Selection On/Off

A data set in the display list can be turned off for subsequent loading in 
the loop.  Click the "Turn Source On/Off" button to toggle the selected data 
source.  If a data source is turned off, the "(Off)" string appears ahead of 
the source name in the "Data Source" GUI.  If a dominant data source is turned 
off, the next data source listed in the GUI will automatically become dominant.

VIII.  "Roam" - Setting Loop Roam Factors

The "Roam" pull down specifies the roam factor that is applied to a loop upon
loading.  Roaming allows viewing a larger portion of a data set than appears
in the NMAP display by scrolling over the image.  The roam factors in the 
pull-down are obtained from the table: $GEMTBL/nmap/nmap_roam.tbl.  See the 
"Roam" help for additional information regarding how roam operates.

IX. "Auto Update" - Setting Auto-update On/Off

The "Auto Update" pop up controls whether auto-update is turned on or off.
Auto-update currently only applies to loops that have image, i.e., radar
or satellite, data sets as the dominant data source.  If auto-update is turned 
on, NMAP checks the loops image data directory every thirty seconds for a new 
image.  If a new image is found, it is loaded into the latest frame in the 
loop.  The oldest frame is deleted to maintain the same number of frames 
in the loop.   Other data sets in the loop are also re-loaded and time matched
to the updated image.

X.  Data Set Plotting Order

Each frame may contain multiple data sets, map overlays, logos and product
generation objects.  NMAP uses the following order in plotting when constructing
a frame: 
 
	Images
	Grid 
	Surface Observations
	Sounding Observations
	Surface Forecast 
	Miscellaneous
	VGF
	Maps/Overlays/Lat/Lon Lines
	Logos
	Active Product Generation

This order means that images are plotted first, then gridded data sets are 
plotted second on top of images, then surface data, and so on.
