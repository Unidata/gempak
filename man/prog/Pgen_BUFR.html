           Product Generation for BUFR File Creation

I.  Functionality

BUFR files may be created from VG files by a three-step process:
	1.  Create the VG file in product generation.
	2.  Convert the VG file to the UKMET browsable ASCII format using 
	    program VG2UKA.
	3.  Convert the ASCII file to BUFR using program BUFRENC.

Both high level (SWH) and mid level (SWM)  significant weather charts 
are supported for conversion from VG to BUFR.

II. Operation
	
A. Creating a High Level (25000 to 63000 feet) Significant Weather (SWH) VG File

Clouds - A single cloud group should consist of a scalloped line and text
containing the base and top of the cloud area in hundreds of feet.  Information
about the distribution, using the abbreviations FRQ, OCNL or ISOL, for
frequent, occasional and isolated, respectively, and type (CB) should be
included with the cloud base and top text.  The cloud level text object is
used.  These elements must be grouped as type CLOUD to be recognized.
 
Fronts - Fronts consist of warm fronts, cold fronts, quasi-stationary fronts
and occluded fronts.  They must be grouped with an arrow vector and text as the
speed.  Each front with any associated arrow and text must be grouped or a
single front may be grouped by itself.  However, if two or more fronts are
grouped together, only the front which was grouped first is currently
recognized.  These elements must be grouped as type FRONT to be recognized.
If an ITCZ line is to be drawn, use special line type number '23'.  It may be
grouped with text.

Jets - These features consist of a jet line, flight level, wind barbs and hash
marks.  The jet line type that is recognized is the special solid line with the
filled in arrow head (special line type 6).  Wind barbs and hash marks may be
used to indicate the wind speeds along the jet.  The beginning and ending
points along the jet represent 80 kts.  Hash marks are changes of 20 kts.  The
flight level is given using text as "FL???", where '???' is how many hundreds
of feet the jet is located.  These elements must be grouped as type JETS to be
recognized.  Flight level deltas are not included in the jet group.  

Alternatively, a jet may be defined in product generation as an (ungrouped) JET
object of class MET.  The jet object contains all the jet elements including
flight level deltas, automatically rotates and "snaps" wind barbs and hash
marks to the jet line, and does not need the grouping.  	 	

Turbulence - Turbulence is shown by using the dashed line and a text box with
the information grouped together.  The turbulence text box object is used.  The
base and top of the turbulence areas are given with a slash separating the two
values.  If either the base or top is unknown, use 'XXX' to designate a
missing value.  These elements must be grouped as type TURB to be recognized.

Tropopause - There are three different types of tropopause labels which are
used, the high, low and spot values.  These are represented by using the text
object and selecting the correct box for the tropopause value to be plotted.
These values are given in hundreds of feet.  These elements are not grouped.

Storms - Tropical storms may be represented by the northern hemisphere and
southern hemisphere tropical storm and hurricane symbols.  They are to be
grouped with the name of the storm.  The text is quoted using double quotes.
These elements must be grouped as type LABEL to be recognized as symbols.

Volcanoes - Volcanoes are drawn using the volcano symbol.  It is grouped with a
text box which contains the volcano name (no quotes) and the latitude and
longitude of the volcano, e.g.,
			Etna
		     37.1N 15.0E
These elements must be grouped as type LABEL to be recognized as symbols.

Radiation - Radiation is represented by plotting the radiation symbol.  There
is no text associated with it and it is not grouped.

B.  Creating a Mid level (10000 to 45000 feet) Significant Weather (SWM) VG File.

All elements of a mid level (SWM) chart are created the same as for a high level 
(SWH) chart, except for clouds.   The cloud line itself is drawn the same as an 
SWH cloud, but the cloud may be labeled in one of two ways.  It may be labeled 
the same way as an SWH cloud (for type CB only), or it may be labeled using the 
mid level cloud text object.  A mid level cloud line and associated text should 
be grouped as type CLOUD.
