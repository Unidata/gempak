				RELOAD

The reload function loads data into the viewed frame in a loop sequence 
without loading data into the other frames.  Reload is useful for updating
displays for data sets where the number of observations grows over a time
period.  For example, METAR reports become more numerous as the time gets
beyond the top of the hour.  Click the "RELOAD" icon located on the upper
left hand side of the main NMAP GUI to reload the data sets associated
with the viewed frame.
