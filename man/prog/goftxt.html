GOFTXT

    GOFTXT is an Offshore Text Formatter (OTF) which creates five-day 
    offshore forecast text from gridded data.  Currently only wind and 
    significant wave heights are considered in the text.  The program is 
    controlled by user inputs in the following format,

	GOFTXT 
	alias for a grid file[|cycle]
	grid times
	alias for a boundary info file

    The alias name for the grid file must be defined in datatype.tbl. To
    run the program properly, grid times have to be in specific time fields
    from different cycles as follows:

		Pacific Zones			Atlantic Zones
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------
	00Z	f15-f57-6;f63-f135-12		f12-f54-6;f60-f132-12
	06Z	f15;f18;f21-f57-6;f69-f129-12	f12;f15;f18-f54-6;f66-f126-12
	12Z	f15-f75-6;f87-f147-12		f12-f72-6;f84-f144-12
	18Z	f15;f18;f21-f69-6;f81-f141-12 	f12;f15;f18-f66-6;f78-f138-12

    The alias name for the boundary info file is defined in clo.tbl.  The
    name of the output file is composed of the last three letters of the info
    file appended with a "_" and a numerical value, i.e., pac_1, pac_2, etc..
    The numbers correspond to the order the offshore zones in g2t_zone.tbl. 
    For example, pac_1 is the output for the Washington zone and pac_2 is the
    output for the Oregon zone.

    A parameter table g2t_parm.tbl includes various parameters which can be
    specified by users.  They may

	(1) Select an index for the center (1 for OPC and 2 for TPC);

	(2) Define a threshold for light winds.  Default is 10 KTS or less;

	(3) Define output wind direction with 1 for clockwise direction and
	    2 from histogram analysis;

	(4) Define maximum allowable wind and wave ranges;

	(5) Define simplification thresholds between RANGE and EXCEPT 
	    portions; and

	(6) Define allowable wind and wave gaps which are the difference 
	    between the RANGE maximum and EXCEPT minimum.
