                                   COLORS


NTRANS colors are listed in the color bar at the bottom of the display window.  
The color bar allows for color editing, toggling, and blinking.  In a single 
panel mode, only the colors used in the frames are listed.  In multi-panel 
mode, all the NTRANS colors are listed.

Click on the desired color number to invoke the color editor.  Alternatively, 
click on the color in the display window using the middle mouse button.  The 
color editor allows editing of the selected color by RGB value, using slider 
bars, or from a list of colors displayed on the color palette.  Pre-defined X 
color names may also be selected from the scroll list.  User-defined colors 
may be saved and restored using the "Save" and "Load" buttons, respectively.

Colors may be toggled off and on by clicking the right mouse button on that 
color from the color bar only.

Color blinking may be achieved by clicking the right mouse button in 
combination with the CONTROL key, <CTRL>-right_mouse_button, on that color 
from the color bar only.
