                              NMAP2 Procedures


I. Functionality

NMAP2 provides the capability to save and restore loop information by using
Stored Procedure Files (SPFs).  The following information can be saved
and retrieved from an SPF for up to eight loops:

        A. Data set name(s) and path(s)
        B. Dominant data set
        C. Skip factor
        D. Number of frames
        E. Roam factor
        F. Auto-update on/off
        G. Pre-defined area name
        H. Graphics area (garea) and map projection (proj)
        I. Map on/off, Lat/Lon lines on/off, Map overlay name(s)
	J. Map and Lat/Lon line overlay attributes, e.g., color and line type 

Attributes for data sets that can be modified by clicking the "Edit Source"
button can also be saved and retrieved.  These include station model 
attributes for surface and upper-air data sets and plotting attributes for 
miscellaneous data sets.

The latest times are used for each SPF specified data set except in the
case of the single time mode.  For that case, the frame number selected in the
time line is saved and is used when the SPF is restored. 

II.  Operation

Save and restore functions are accessed by clicking the "Save Data Settings" 
and "Restore Data Settings" buttons in the "Data Selection Window".

The "Save Data Settings" function saves loop information to a user selected
ASCII SPF for all of the loops loaded in the "Data Selection Window" GUI. For 
example, suppose loop 1 contains GOES East Satellite imagery and METAR surface
observations and loop 2 contains radar imagery and model data.  To save this 
information to an SPF, click the "Save Data Settings" which invokes the 
"Save to SPF file" GUI.  This GUI allows the user to select an existing SPF 
name or to specify a new SPF name.  This GUI allows the user to select whether 
to save each specified SPF data source's current time or to have the data
source restored using the latest available time.  The "Save to SPF file" GUI 
operates in a similar fashion as the VGF open/save GUI.  SPFs are listed in 
the GUI by directory name.  Directory names are specified in the table, 
GEMTBL/nmap/spf.tbl.

If a source is turned off in the "Data Selection Window", it is not saved to 
the SPF.  However, if the turned off source is an image, its projection is 
saved to the SPF.  Upon restore, the default garea and proj for the dominant 
data source in the SPF is used.  It is recommended that all data sources be 
turned on when saving to an SPF to avoid confusion.

The "Restore Data Settings" function fills the "Data Selection Window" GUI with 
loop information specified in an SPF.  It does not load the data into the loop
frames.  In this way the user has the opportunity to modify any settings 
before loading.  To retrieve a desired SPF click the "Restore Data Settings" 
button.  The "Restore from SPF file" GUI is invoked which presents the same 
list of directories and SPFs as the "Save from SPF file" GUI discussed above.  
Select the desired SPF from the scroll list and click the "OK" button.  A 
"Restore Confirmation" GUI is invoked which lists the data source and dominant 
data for each loop.  Click the "Accept" or "Cancel" button to fill the 
"Data Selection Window" GUI, or to select another SPF, respectively.

Restore clears out all loop information from the "Data Selection Window". 
For example, suppose NMAP2 has data sets, map areas and other information 
filled in for loops 1, 2 and 3.  Selecting an SPF with loops 1 and 2 specified 
overides the current loop information in loops 1 and 2 and clears the data 
sets in loop 3.  In addition, map areas, and overlays are set to the defaults 
for loops 3 - 8.

III.  SPF Creation, Editing and Error Processing

The SPF is an editable ASCII file.  It is recommended that the "Save Data 
Settings" button be used to save procedures instead of creating an SPF from 
scratch.  In this way the user is assured that the SPF will have the correct 
format and operate as intended.  The "Save Data Settings" function 
automatically adds a prolog to the SPF including account name and creation 
date.

A user edited SPF has the potential for improper formatting and errors.
Invalid SPF entries are handled according to the following rules.

A.  Invalid entries in SPF are noted in "Error Messages" pop-up upon 
    restore.

B.  No attempt is made to restore a data set with invalid data 
    source values.  Valid data sources are consecutively renumbered
    when restoring. For example, if source 1 is invalid, then source 
    2 becomes source 1 and source 3 becomes source 2, and so on upon 
    restoring.

C.  If the dominant data source entry is invalid, the first data 
    source becomes dominant.  If the first data source entry is 
    dominant and invalid, then the next data source becomes the 
    dominant one.

D.  If skip value is invalid, it is set to 0 meaning no frames are
    skipped.

E.  If the frames value is invalid, it is set to the default value for 
    corresponding data type. The default is determined by the first value 
    specified in the table $GEMTBL/config/datatyp.tbl.

F.  Invalid roam factors are set to 0 (fit to screen).  A roam factor 
    of 1 (size of image) will be set to 0 if no image source exists 
    for a given loop.

G.  If the auto update value is invalid, it is set to 1, which is on.

H.  If either the garea or proj value is invalid in the SPF, then 

    1) If imagery is displayed, then garea is set to the
       entire image using the the image projection;

    2) If imagery is not displayed, then garea and proj are
       set to the default values that are retrieved from
       the first entry in the $GEMTBL/nmap/mapinfo.tbl table.

I.  If the pre-defined area name is invalid but garea and proj are valid, 
    then the name is set to "CUSTOM" and the garea and proj values 
    from the SPF are used.


IV. SPF Syntax

The SPF has two columns.  The first column is a reserved keyword that indicates
the loop attribute.  The second column is the value for that loop attribute.
Keywords and their values are grouped by loop in the file. The exclamation 
point, !, precedes comment lines in the file.

The following table lists the reserved keywords and their valid values 
specified in the Definitions section.

    <reserved keyword>  	Valid value(s)

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Definitions:

    Category : Data Category type, e.g., CAT_SFC for METAR data.  This
               value comes from the CATEGORY column in the 
               $GEMTBL/config/datatyp.tbl
    Data Source : Source names listed in the "Data Source" GUI separated
                  by slashes, e.g., SURF_OBS/METAR/standard
    N : Loop number (integer,  0 < N < 9 )
    M : Source number for a given loop (integer, M > 0)
    D : Dominant data source number (integer, D > 0)
    W : Number of frames to load (integer, 0 < W < 80)
    X : Frame Skip factor (integer, 0 <= X < W  )
    Y : Roam Factor (integer 0 = fit to screen, 
                     1 = size of image, 1 < Y < 20 roam factor )
    Z : Auto Update Flag ( 0 = off, 1 = on ) 
    Area name : Pre-defined area name.  This string is from the list of
                selections that appear along the left side of the
                "Map Selection" GUI.  The values are specified in the
                $GEMTBL/nmap/mapinfo.tbl table. 
    proj : GEMPAK proj value
    garea : GEMPAK garea value
    Map : Literal "Map" string.  If this string is not present, 
          then the default map is not drawn.
    Lat/Lon : Literal "Lat/Lon" string.  If this string is not present,
              then lat/lon lines are not drawn.
    V :	  Single time mode on/off flag, 1 = on, 0 = off
    FN :  Frame number

Note 1:
-------
	The <loopN_sourceM_attr> entry appears only for data sets that can have
	their plotting attributes edited in NMAP.  These data sets include those
	under the SURF_OBS, SURF_FCST, UAIR_OBS, and MISC categories.  The
	attributes are specified following the conventions defined in 
	$GEMTBL/config/prmlst.tbl for data sets in the SURF_OBS, SURF_FCST
	and UAIR_OBS categories, and the table $GEMTBL/config/miscset.tbl
	for data sets in the MISC category.  The default values from these
	tables are used if the loopN_sourceM_attr entry is not present in the
	SPF.

Note 2:
-------
	The <loopN_map_ovl> entries are attributes associated with overlays
	shown in the "Map Selection" GUI.  The attributes are specified 
	following the conventions defined in $GEMTBL/nmap/mapovl.tbl.  For
	map type overlays the attributes are GEMPAK color number, line type
	and line width.  For the lat/lon overlay, the attributes are GEMPAK
	color number, line type, line width, lat/lon plotting increment
	in degrees and label frequency.  For station table type overlays
	the attributes are GEMPAK color number, marker type, marker size, 
	marker state, marker text size, and marker width.   The default
        values from the mapovl.tbl table are used if the attributes are
	not specified in the SPF.
