                            COLOR ENHANCEMENT


The "Enh_list" pop-up allows images to be color-enhanced according to 
pre-defined color lookup tables.  Different enhancement curves highlight 
different meteorological features.  Activate this pop-up in NMAP with a 
selection from the "Option" menu.  In NSAT, select from the "Tool" menu or 
press <ctrl-E> on the keyboard.

The pop-up presents a scroll list of enhancements.  Click on an enhancement to 
apply it to the loaded images, even when the images are looping.

Many of the enhancements in the scroll list are named according to their 
intended application.  Names that start with "ir_" are intended for infrared 
(IR) imagery.  Names that start with "wv_" are intended for water vapor imagery.
Names that start with "vis" are intended for imagery from the visible channels.

The "lingray" (linear gray scale) enhancement is the default.

In NMAP, the overall image brightness may be changed in addition to the selected
enhancement.  Use the "Fade" slider located on the main display window.  The 
"half" and "none" buttons associated with the "Fade" slider permit the image to 
be easily reset to the default (half) brightness or to no brightness (fully 
faded out).

If multiple applications are running under NTL control, then the color 
enhancements and brightness levels selected in one application also apply to 
images displayed in the other.
