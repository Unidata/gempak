DCMSFC

    DCMSFC decodes raw buoy, ship, C-MAN, and Coast Guard reports from
    a real-time data feed, or from a file fed to the program through
    standard input, and writes the data to a GEMPAK surface file.  The
    program is controlled by inputs to the command line.

    The inputs are program options and the output file name or template.
    For example, for real-time data feeds:
    
	dcmsfc [options] output_file

    Currently, the decoder can be run in two different modes.  If the -a
    option is not used, the decoder will create hourly files of all 
    marine surface data (ship, C-MAN, fixed and drifting buoys, Coast
    Guard).  If the option "-a 6" is specified, 6-hour files of ship
    data only will be created.  For real-time operation, output files
    have the form YYYYMMDDHH.ship, and are placed in different
    directories depending on whether they are hourly or 6-hour files.

    If running the program interactively with standard input, the -c
    option must be used.  The input file must be also be specified.
    For example:

	dcmsfc -c YYMMDD/HHNN [other_options] output_file < input_file
    
    A template may be used to specify the output file name.  The file
    name template uses the date and time of the bulletin or report
    to replace the following characters.

	YYYY or YY	Year with or without the century
	MM		Month number
	DD		Day
	HH		Hour
	NN		Minute
