			       LOCATOR


The locator text box (at the lower right hand corner of the main NMAP GUI)
displays cursor location information.  As the cursor is moved within the 
NMAP data display window, the locator display can show one of three types of
location information:

	1) the cursor latitude/longitude,
	2) the cursor's position relative to discreet geographical locations 
           stored in a GEMPAK station table format, e.g., distance and direction 
           to the nearest city,
	3) the name of the bounded geographic region, e.g., county name, that
           the cursor is within.

Click the arrow button to the right of the locator text box to select the
desired station data set or bounded region.  A pop-up list of available
choices appears.  Click the desired choice and the cursor position will
be given relative to that data set.  

The locator attributes such as distance and direction units can be modified.
Click the "Edit..." button to invoke the "LOCATOR SELECT and EDIT" GUI.  This
GUI allows the setting of distance units, e.g., nautical miles vs. kilometers,
direction units, e.g., 16 degree compass, and distance rounding for station
data sets.  The "DISPLAY" pop up provides a choice of what column of the
station table to display, e.g., station ID vs. station name, and the 
latitude/longitude units, decimal degrees vs. degrees and minutes.  Click the 
"Defaults" button to set the attributes back to their default values for all 
locator data sets.

The list of available locator data sets is specified by the tables
$GEMTBL/config/clo.tbl and $GEMTBL/nmap/locator.tbl.  The clo.tbl defines 
alias names for the station and bounds data sets.  Any GEMPAK station table
and bounded area data set can be specified.  The locator.tbl defines the 
default display attributes.  See these tables for additional information.
