CLIPVGF
                                                                       
  CLIPVGF clips elements in a VGF file based on a bounds specification.  

INPUT PARAMETERS

  clipvgf input_filename clip_bound keep_flag output_filename

  clipvgf		Program name
  input_filename	VGF file to be clipped
  clip_bound		Bounds name of geographical clipping area; format:
	bound_name|<area_tag_name>area_tag_value
  	and must be enclosed w/ quotes so the shell will ignore directives.
  keep_flag		"keep" keeps all element points inside clip_bound;
			anything else tosses element points inside clip_bound.
  output_filename	Clipped VGF file
  clip_accuracy		Either "rough" (default and fast) or "exact" (slower)
                                                                       
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

  CLIPVGF scans a VGF file and tests each element for clipping against a
  bounds area. Users are given a choice of employing one of two clipping 
  techniques.

  CLIPPING TECHNIQUE (ACCURACY)
  If "rough" clipping is requested, a simple clipping algorithm is used. 
  Element (lat,lon) points are determined to be either inside or outside 
  of the geographical clip area and are either kept or thrown away based 
  on the input flag "keep_flag".  Note that linear elements such as fronts 
  and lines will not be clipped precisely at the clip area boundary when
  using this option.

  If "exact" clipping is requested, a more accurate clip algorithm is
  used.  The result is that linear objects are clipped precisely at the bounds'
  edges.

  NOTE: In both cases, the line's unsmoothed points are used to determine
  the clip edges. Therefore if the line has a smoothing factor, the resulting 
  line may not have precisely the same curvature as the original, unclipped 
  line when the smoothing factor is re-applied.

  LABELING
  If a linear object is grouped with a text label, the resulting clipped 
  object will also be grouped with the same text label even if this label 
  must be created. Labels such as these will be located midway between the 
  first and second points of the clipped line.  If a symbol is grouped with 
  a text label, the text label will be either clipped or not depending on 
  whether the symbol is clipped or not.

  The following element classes are not processed:			
  CLASS_WATCHES, CLASS_TRACKS, CLASS_SIGMETS				

  The bounds area MUST be a single area, i.e., it may not have multiple parts
  such as islands. The only bounds file designed specifically for clipping 
  (only one part per bound area) is the seamless surface analysis (SSA) file.  
  This bounds file contains the following areas:
  AREA		SVC CNTR	
  ----		--------
  HPC050	HPC
  OPC050_PAC	OPC
  OPC050_ATL	OPC
  OPC215_PAC	OPC
  OPC215_ATL	OPC
  TPC050	TPC
  TPC215	TPC
  PR		PR (Pacific Region)

EXAMPLES

  clipvgf input.vgf "SSA|<AREA>OPC050_ATL" keep output.vgf rough

	- clips the VGF file "input.vgf" against the seamless surface analysis
	  bounds area named "OPC050_ATL".  Element points within this bounds
	  area are saved into the VGF file "output.vgf". Uses the simple
	  clip algorithm.

  clipvgf input.vgf "SSA|<AREA>TPC215" notkeep output.vgf exact

	- clips the VGF file "input.vgf" against the seamless surface analysis
	  bounds area named "TPC215".  Element points outside of this bounds
	  area are saved into the VGF file "output.vgf". Linear objects are
	  clipped exactly at the boundaries.
