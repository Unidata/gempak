                             GRAPH - to - GRID


This function generates a grid from contour lines drawn via NMAP product 
generation.  

    Procedure

    To generate contours, invoke NMAP and enter product generation.
    Contours are defined as a simple solid line grouped with a numeric
    text value using 'LABEL' grouping.  The label may be located anywhere.
    Any number of equal-valued labels may be grouped with any number of lines.
    When drawing, labeling and grouping have been completed, a text file
    containing the geographical contour coordinates must be created.  Click
    'PROD' then 'GRAPH GRID'.  A popup will appear with cycle and forecast
    time information which may be edited.  Clicking "Advanced..." enables the
    user to assign or modify the parameter information as well as the 
    computational grid information.  Clicking "Show Extensions" displays 
    virtual lines extending from contours which are not closed.  These lines
    must not cross each other within the bounds of the computational grid.

    When the grid computation is complete, the grid is contoured and
    displayed under the VGF lines using CINT and LINE.  If CINT is not
    specified, contour levels identical to those drawn will be used.


    PARAMETERS
 
    CYCLE     Standard GEMPAK date/time (YYYYMMDD/HHHH)
    FCSTHR    Forecast hour (fFFF)

    PATH      Directory path for output grid file
    GDOUTF    Output grid file
    PROJ      Map projection/angles/margins|drop flag 
    GRDAREA   Area covered by grid 
    KXKY      Number of grid points in x;y 
    MAXGRD    Maximum number of grids 
    CPYFIL    Grid definition 
    ANLYSS    Grid analysis block 
    CNTRFL    Contour file
    GDATTIM   Grid date/time
    GFUNC     Scalar grid parameter name 
    GLEVEL    Grid level 
    GVCOORD   Grid vertical coordinate 
    KEYCOL    Key color
    KEYLINE   Key Line (LINE or SPLN/subtyp)
    OLKDAY    Day of extended outlook
    GGLIMS    Grid value limitations and control
    HISTGRD   Toggle writing history grid (y/n)
 
    CINT      Contour interval specs for displaying computed grid 
    LINE      Line information for displaying computed grid
    FINT      Fill interval specs for displaying computed grid
    FLINE     Fill information for displaying computed grid
    CLRBAR    Color/ornt/anch/x;y/ln;wd/freq|text_info

    Several parameters (PROJ, GRDAREA, KXKY, MAXGRD, CPYFIL, ANLYSS) are
    intended to be used identically as in the programs GDCFIL and NAGRIB.
    These define the grid (and gridfile) to create the data.
    The grid is written to file GDOUTF with parameter name GFUNC valid
    at CYCLE/FCSTHR.  GLEVEL and GVCOORD may be assigned accordingly.
    KEYCOL indicates which lines actually get processed; =0 processes all
    lines, =n processes only lines with color n.  Note that unless CNTRFL 
    contains an explicit path, the ASCII ".info" text file will be written 
    into the same directory from which the original VGF file was opened.

    GRPHGD loosely follows an algorithm originally described in TDL OFFICE
    NOTE 92-14 "The Systematic Interpolative Radial Search (SIRS) -- A
    Method to Compute Gridpoint Values from Contours".  Some minor changes
    were incorporated to improve data consistency and to increase execution
    efficiency.  The program performs three primary methodologies to
    assign values at gridpoints: 1) radial search and assignment, 2) gradient
    search and assignment where 1) could not be achieved, and 3) weighted
    search and assignment where neither 1) nor 2) could be achieved.
    A 9-point smoother is applied as a final step.
