                                  HOT KEYS


Pressing keyboard keys allows easy access to selected Nmap functions.  All 
Nmap hot keys are case insensitive. Only the lower case are listed below. 

The hot keys for Nmap/Nmap2 display functions:

    -  Step backward / Halt loop
    =  Step forward / Halt loop
    l  Loop forward / Halt loop

    f  Reset the fade on the current look-up table and restores the current 
       look-up table

    h  Turns all background data on/off by toggling the hide/show loop button

    i  Turns an image "on/off" by toggling the fade between black and the 
       default brightness setting

    w  Toggle the data window up or down (Same as mouse button 3)

    a  Toggle the auto-update on or off for the individual loop.

    A  Toggle the auto-update lock or unlock for all loops.

The numeric key pad arrow keys (2, 4, 6, 8) roam in the direction of the 
respective arrow when in the roam mode.  (Note that this function is currently
not supported on IRIX5/IRIX6 platforms.)

The following hot keys display different loops for Nmap2:

    F1  View loop 1
    F2  View loop 2
    F3  View loop 3
    F4  View loop 4
    F5  View loop 5
    F6  View loop 6
    F7  View loop 7
    F8  View loop 8
   
To access loops 9 through 16, press the <shift> key and then press the F key.  
For example, <shift> F3, views loop 11.

The following list hot keys for Nmap/Nmap2 product generation functions:

    u  Undo
    r  Redo

The numeric hot keys control which layer is active.  Keys 1...0 switch the 
active layer to layers 1 - 10, respectively.  The key combination of Shift 
and 1...0 change the active layer to layers 11 - 20, respectively.

The "Filter Control" GUI allows hot keys to enable the user to step from one 
time to the next.  These are the "[" and "]" keys.  The "[" key steps the 
control from right to left and the the "]" steps from left to right. 

The delete key can be used to delete selected elements.  It works in 
both select and multi-select modes.  This is a keyboard shortcut that 
functions the same as the Delete Action on the palette.  It can be undone 
using the Undo Action button.

The up and down arrows on the keyboard (meaning the up/down keys in the small 
cluster of four directional keys located between the main keypad and the 
numeric keypad) may be used to select the active segment of a TCA when the
TCA GUI is active.
