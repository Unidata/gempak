                             DWELL RATE


The "Dwell Rate" pop-up sets the speed of animation.  This pop-up is activated 
in NMAP with a selection from the "Option" menu.  In NSAT, NTRANS, and NAFOS it 
is activated from the "Tool" menu or it may be invoked by pressing <ctrl-D>.

The pop-up provides for five pre-set speeds as well as slider bars for an even 
greater flexibility in setting the animation speeds.  Click on one of the 
pre-set speeds and the three sliders adjust to the corresponding settings.  
Alternately, adjust the slider bars individually by dragging them using the 
mouse.  The numbers to the right of the slider bars indicate the dwell times 
in seconds.

The slider bar labeled "first" controls the length of pause on the first frame 
in an animation sequence.  The "intermediate" slider bar controls the length of 
pause between frames.  The "last" slider bar controls the length of pause on 
the last frame.  Each slider bar has a range of 0.01 to 3 seconds per frame.
