DCSVRL

    DCSVRL decodes severe local storm reports (tornado and severe
    thunderstorm watch reports) from a real-time data feed, or from
    a file fed to the program through standard input, and writes the
    data to an ASCII file.  The program is controlled by inputs to
    the command line.

    The inputs are program options and the output file name or template.
    For example, for real-time data feeds:
    
	dcsvrl [options] output_file

    If running the program interactively with standard input, the -c
    option must be used.  The input file must also be specified.
    For example:

	dcsvrl -c YYMMDD/HHNN [other_options] output_file < input_file
    
    A template may be used to specify the output file name.  The file
    name template uses the date and time of the bulletin or report
    to replace the following characters.

	YYYY or YY	Year with or without the century
	MM		Month number
	DD		Day
	HH		Hour
	NN		Minute


     The format of the output ASCII file is as follows:

        |Type|Start_time|End_time|Watch_number|Corr_flag
        County_station_table_information_1
        County_station_table_information_2
	...
        County_station_table_information_N

     Where: Type is TS (severe thunderstorm) or TN (tornado)
	    Start_time and End_time are full GEMPAK date/time strings
	    Watch_number is the watch number
	    Corr_flag is a flag indicating a correction (0 or 1)

     Extra spaces may appear anywhere in this line of information,
     except in the first character position.  The first character must
     be a bar (|).

     The County_station_table_information is read using the FORTRAN format
     (A8,1X,I6,1X,A32,1X,A2,1X,A2,1X,F9.2,1X,F9.2,1X,F9.2,1X,I2,1X,A20).
     The county information is the same as in the GEMPAK station tables.
