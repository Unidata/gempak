                                USER-DEFINED


This pop-up is a file selection utility that allows selection of metafiles 
from user directories.  It is located under the "File" pull-down menu and may 
be invoked by clicking on "User-Defined," or by typing CTRL-F in the NTRANS 
panel.

Specify the base directory in the dialogue box (Filter) of this file 
selection utility to search for files.

For example, the filter "/export/sgi19/user/meta/*.META" finds all files in 
the directory /export/sgi19/user/meta (directory mask) whose names end with 
".META" (search pattern).

The user may edit the directory mask and search pattern in the filter 
dialogue box.  The filter understands standard shell meta- characters such 
as ?, ~, *, etc.  Changes to the filter will be saved internally for future 
invocations of the file selection panel.

A sub-directory list (Directories) and a file list (Files) are displayed under 
the filter dialogue box.  The user may select a new directory by scrolling 
through the list of directories and selecting one.  Double clicking the left 
mouse button on a directory in the directory list, or selecting the directory 
then clicking the "Search" button at the bottom of the pop-up window, will 
initiate a search for files and sub-directories in the new directory using 
the current search pattern.

The default directory mask is the current working directory.

The bottom dialogue box (Selection) displays the currently selected file.  
Enter a file name here or select one with the left mouse button from the file 
lists.  The user may select a new file as many times as desired.

After selecting the desired file, click the "Select" button to complete the 
file selection process.  Double clicking the desired file in the file list 
will have the same effect.  The file selection pop-up window will disappear 
and the specified file has been selected.

The "CANCEL" button de-activates the file select pop-up window.
