GPFAX creates a Postscript, GIF, or TIFF file, or an X Windows display
from a 6-bit fax file.


INPUT PARAMETERS
 
    <a href=../parm/device.html>DEVICE</a>    Device|name|x size;y size|color type
    <a href=../parm/faxfil.html>FAXFIL</a>    6-bit FAX product filename
 
 
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
 
    GPFAX reads a 6-bit FAX file and creates an output product in
    either the PostScript, GIF, or TIFF format.  The program can also
    display the 6-bit FAX product as image using XW device driver.

    Only one 6-bit FAX product can be processed at a time.  If there
    are multiple products in a single file, then only the first
    product is read.

    The output product size, specified in the <a href=../parm/device.html>DEVICE</a> parameter, should be
    properly set to correctly scale the FAX product.  For the GIF and
    TIFF devices, the xsize and ysize should be obtained from the
    entries in the table $GEMTBL/pgen/faxprod.tbl that correspond to
    the input FAX product identification number.  For example, the
    x and y dimensions for the 411X FAX product are 1728 and 864,
    respectively.  These are obtained from the fourth and fifth columns
    corresponding to the 411X entry in the table.

    For the TIFF device driver, the output file is always named as
    FAX.tiff.  The output file must be renamed, otherwise it will be
    overwritten by subsequent executions of the program.


EXAMPLES
 
    1.  Create a GIF file of 5-Day MRF MOS Mean chart, (6-bit FAX ID 411X).

	<a href=../parm/device.html>DEVICE</a> = gif|411X.gif|1728;864
	<a href=../parm/faxfil.html>FAXFIL</a> = 411X.6bt


    2.  Create a TIFF file of the four panel low-level significant weather
        chart, (6-bit FAX ID 501X).

	<a href=../parm/device.html>DEVICE</a> = tiff||1728;1133
	<a href=../parm/faxfil.html>FAXFIL</a> = 501X.6bt


ERROR MESSAGES
 
    [GPFAX  -1]     Fatal error.
