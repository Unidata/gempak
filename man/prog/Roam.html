				Roam


The roam function provides a way of viewing an enlarged data region by 
scrolling over the region.  The amount of data region magnification is 
controlled by a user-selected roam factor.  Each loop can have different 
roaming factors or no roaming at all.

There are several ways to invoke roaming.  Click the "Roam" pull down below 
the main NMAP title to immediately apply the desired roaming factor to the 
visible loop.  Alternatively, the roam factor can be pre-selected for a loop
by clicking the "Roam" button in the "Data Selection Window".  In this case,
roaming is applied to the loop after the "Load" button is clicked.  Roam 
factors for each loop can also be specified by using Stored Procedure 
Files (SPFs).  See the "Procedures" help for additional details.  Finally, 
roam factors may be shared among loops by using the "Apply/Get Map Settings" 
buttons in the "Map Selection" GUI.  See the "Map-Selection" help for further 
details.

When roaming is activated, the "Roam Control" GUI is visible.  The "Roam 
Control" GUI is used to pan across the roamed data region.  The position of 
the white rectangle in the blue region of the GUI indicates what portion of the 
enlarged data region is visible.  To roam, move the mouse cursor into the blue 
region and drag the white rectangle using the left mouse button.  For more 
precise roaming, click on the arrow keys in the GUI.  Alternatively, press 
the key pad numbers 8, 6, 2, 4 to roam up, right, down, and left, respectively.  
The key pad numbers are especially helpful if the user does not want to move 
the mouse cursor while roaming.  The mouse cursor must be in the data display
window, not in the "Roam Control" GUI, to use the key pad numbers.

The amount of data region magnification is controlled by multiplying the data 
region's area by the roam factor.  Thus, a roam factor of 2 (shown as 2 x 
screen size in the pull down) produces an area with twice the number of pixels, 
a roam factor of 3 produces an area with three times the number of pixels, and 
so on.  Roam factors are specified in the table $GEMTBL/nmap/nmap_roam.tbl.  
The table allows up to 19 roam factors with integer values ranging from 2 
through 20.   For image data, a "Size of Image" roam factor is also available.  
This roam factor creates a full resolution image covering the entire image 
area.  For example, if an image data set is 2000 by 2000 pixels, selecting 
"Size of Image" loads the entire 2000 by 2000 pixel into display memory for 
roaming.
 
Select the "Fit to Screen" to exit roaming.   This action will re-load the data
region and fit it to the NMAP data display window.
