                                SELECT GROUP


This pop-up loads product groups for a selected metafile.  A product group 
is usually either a sequence of forecasts or a set of products at a valid time.
This pop-up is invoked by pressing the right mouse button while the cursor is 
in the data area.

Click on the desired product group from the scroll list.  The selection is 
highlighted.  Click on the appropriate button under "Load Panel" to load the 
product sequence into the display memory.

"Clear Screen" wipes clean all the available frames.

Click "set" to assign a valid time to each frame based on the times within 
the selected group.  Click "clear" to un-set any valid times previously 
assigned.  Once a sequence of valid times has been set, all subsequent groups 
will be loaded into the proper frames based on the times.  This capability 
allows users to use multi-panel mode (described below) to compare various
model runs with variable start times and still maintain a synchronized 
animation sequence.

Click on an option in the Panel structure section to specify how multiple 
panels are arranged within the display area.  The selected structure is 
reflected by the "Load panel" buttons.  Click with either the left or right 
mouse button to load the selected group into that button's area of the display 
window.  The right button will also remove the "Select Group" and "Select
Model" pop-ups prior to beginning the load.
