                            LINE ATTRIBUTES


The "Line Attributes" pop-ups are used to change the color, line width, and 
line style of maps, lat/lon lines, and AFOS graphic products.  In NMAP, on the 
"Map Selection" window, click on any of the "Map", "Lat/Lon", "County", 
"River", or "Road" buttons to activate the associated "Line Attributes" pop-up. 
In NSAT, select "Attributes" in the "Tool" menu and click on "Map" or "Lat/Lon."
In NAFOS, select "Line/Color Attributes" in the "Tool" menu and click on "Base 
Map," "Lat/Lon," or one of the 6 products.

On the "Line Attributes" pop-up, choose the line color, line width, and line 
style from the "Color", "Width", and "Style" menus, respectively.  Click the 
"Compress", "Normal", and "Expand" buttons to control the spacing between line
elements (dashes and dots).

In NMAP, pressing the "Accept" button saves the line attribute changes toward 
the next load and shows the changes on the "Map Selection" window.  In NSAT, 
clicking the "Apply" button saves the selections and re-loads the image 
sequence immediately.  In NAFOS, clicking the "Load" button also saves the 
selections and re-loads the products immediately.
