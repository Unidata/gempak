DCWCN

DCWCN decodes watch county notification reports from a real-time data 
feed, or from a file fed to the program through standard input, 
and writes the data to an ASCII file.  The program is controlled 
by inputs to the command line.

The inputs are program options and the output file name or template.
For example, for real-time data feeds:
    
	DCWCN [options] output_file

If running the program interactively with standard input, the -c
option must be used.  The input file must also be specified.
For example:

	DCWCN -c YYMMDD/HHNN [other_options] output_file < input_file
    
A template may be used to specify the output file name.  The file
name template uses the date and time of the bulletin or report
to replace the following characters.

	YYYY or YY	Year with or without the century
	MM		Month number
	DD		Day
	HH		Hour
	NN		Minute


PROGRAM METHODOLOGY FOR TIME STRINGS

When decoding WCNs, assumptions on time varibles are made for those cases
where the watch start time is '000000T0000Z'.

For 'NEW' reports, the watch starting and ending times are decoded
from the VTEC line.

For 'CON' reports, where the watch starting time is '000000T0000Z' 
in the VTEC line, the start time is set equal to the bulletin issue time 
and the ending time is decoded from the VTEC line.

For 'CAN' reports, where the watch starting time is '000000T0000Z' 
in the VTEC line, the ending time is decoded from the VTEC line and
the starting time is set equal to the ending time.

OUTPUT FORMATING

The format of the output ASCII file is as follows:

|Watch|Issue|Start|Stop|Watch |Bulletin  |Action;Significance|Corr|Cancel|Test
|type |time |time |time|number|originator|code   code        |flag|flag  |flag

County/marine zone table entries, one per line, formatted as shown in the 
example below (county/marine zone information lines should appear just as they 
do in $GEMTBL/stns/mzcntys.tbl)
.        .      .                                .  .   .     .         .  . .
.        .      .                                .  .   .     .         .  . .

where:

Watch type is           TSM     thunderstorm watch
                        TOR     tornado watch

Issue time is           YYMMDD/HHMM - GEMPAK date/time format - time of the
                                      of the WCN bulletin
Start time is           YYMMDD/HHMM - GEMPAK date/time format - Start time
                                      of the WCN bulletin
Stop time is            YYMMDD/HHMM - GEMPAK date/time format - End time of
                                      of the WCN bulletin

Bulletin originator is  KALY, KBGM, etc. from 2nd field of 1st line of bulletin

Watch number		is the decoded watch number

Action code             is the action on the counties listed
                           	NEW - new counties in the watch
                           	CON - continuing counties in the watch
                           	EXT - extending the time of the watch
                           	EXA - extending the area of the watch
                           	EXT - extending the area and time of the watch
                           	EXP - normal expiration of counties
                           	CAN - canceling counties from the watch

Significance code       A       Watch

Correction flag         0       Not a correction
                        1       A correction

Cancel flag             0       Not a cancellation or expired report
                        1       A cancellation or expired report

Test flag               0       Not a test report
                        1       A test report
