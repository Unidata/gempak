JOINVGF
                                                                       
  JOINVGF connects similar linear objects in two VGF files if certain
	  distance criterion is met.  

INPUT PARAMETERS

  joinvgf input_filename1 input_filename2 output_filename [tolerance]

  joinvgf		Program name.
  input_filename1	VGF file1 to be examined for connection.
  input_filename2	VGF file2 to be examined for connection.
  output_filename	VGF file containing elements from fiel1 and file2.
  [tolerance]		Distance in kilometers within which points from
			two separate lines are to be connected, optional.
			The default value is currently set to 0.5 km.
                                                                       
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

  JOINVGF scans two VGF files and tests linear objects for "similarity". 
  If two objects are found to be "similar" the objects are further tested
  for "closeness".  After that there are two possibilities:
  1) If "closeness" is met, JOINVGF proceeds with connecting the objects
     following the CONNECTION RULES. 
  2) If "closeness" is NOT met, the objects are not connected.  Resulting
     output file contains elements from file1 followed by elements from
     file2 as they are.

  CONNECTION RULES
  * order of points from file1 is never reversed;
  * order of points from file2 may be reversed;
  * points from file2 may proceed or follow points from file1;
  * connecting point is not repeated but taken as average of two 
    neighboring points;
  * the resulting line may be closed if the endpoints meet the 
    "closeness" test;
  * the attributes of the resulting connected linear object are inherited 
    from file1, including the group associations;

  LABELING
  Each linear object is permitted to keep its label.

  USAGE NOTES
  1.  The following element classes are not processed:			
  CLASS_WATCHES, CLASS_TRACKS, CLASS_SIGMETS.
  2.  It is assumed that two input VGF files are the result of clipping
  of some initial VGF file by program CLIPVGF using "exact" clipping
  algorithm.

EXAMPLE

  joinvgf input1.vgf input2.vgf output.vgf 0.1

	- the programs searches input1.vgf and input2.vgf for lines,
	  endpoints of which are closer than 0.1 km; if found, the lines
	  are connected in the resulting file output.vgf, otherwise - 
          they are written out unconnected.
