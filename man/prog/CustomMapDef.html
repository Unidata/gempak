                              CUSTOMIZED MAP DEFINITION


The "Customized Map Definition" pop-up allows an increased level of 
flexibility in specifying geographic areas.  Click the "Custom" button below
the pre-defined area buttons to invoke this pop-up.  

The "Customized Map Definition" window permits direct control over the GEMPAK 
parameters GAREA and PROJ.  Initially the window shows the current settings of 
the two variables.  GAREA specifies the geographic area while PROJ specifies the 
map projection over that area.

GAREA may be specified in several ways.  A pre-defined GEMPAK area name, 
e.g., US, may be used.  Any GEMPAK area defined in the table 
$GEMTBL/stns/geog.tbl may be entered.  Alternatively, user-specified lat/lon 
values separated by semi-colons can be entered to define the bounds of the 
region.  The lower left lat;lon values followed by the upper right lat;lon
values specify the bounding rectangle.  Any station ID, from the table 
$GEMTBL/stns/sfstns.tbl, may also be entered to define the center point of 
the geographic region.  The "+/-" notation may be used (when appended to a 
station ID or a geographic area abbreviation, each "-" increases the area 
extent while "+" decreases it).  

If a satellite or radar image is one of the selected data sets, "DSET" may be 
entered into the "GAREA" field to match the image coverage.

The map projection, entered in the "PROJ" text box may be specified as a 
simple or full projection (including projection angles and margins).  Any
valid GEMPAK projection name can be specified.  The radio buttons display
the more commonly used map projections and may be clicked to select the
desired projection.  A more complete list of map projections is available for 
selection from the "Others" pull-down.  In addition, the projection may be set 
using one of the special key words "DEF", "SAT", or "RAD."  "DEF" indicates that 
the projection associated with the GAREA entry obtained from the geog.tbl is 
used.  Click the "DEF Content" button to see the projection obtained from the 
table. "SAT" indicates that the projection definition is taken from the 
satellite image.  "SAT" applies only if a satellite image is one of the selected 
data sets.  "RAD" works similarly to "SAT" for radar images.  If a satellite or 
radar image is selected, the projection cannot be altered.

To apply changes to the "Map Selection" window without closing the "Customized 
Map Definition" pop-up, click anywhere in the "GAREA" or "PROJ" type-in fields 
and press the <Enter> key on the keyboard.  Alternately, click the "Accept" 
button to close the pop-up and apply the changes to the "Map Selection" 
window.
