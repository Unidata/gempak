DAT2PTS

This program converts the:

     - Outlook verification files to the Outlook Points text product, 

     - the Fire Weather Outlook verification files to the Fire 
       Weather Outlook Points text product,

     - and the Experimental Enhanced Thunderstorm Outlook
       verification files to the Experimental Enhanced Thunderstorm 
       Outlook Points text product.

The program gets the user input from the command line. The usage for
the program is as follows:

	dat2pts # DDHHNN T N ND 

where,

	#          is the day of the forecast period (1,2,3).  For
		   extended forecasts, such as Day 3-8 or Day 4-8,
		   then # is 38 or 48, respectively. 

	DDHHNN     is the day, hour and minute of the product as
	           it appears in the verification file names,
                   in the case of the experimental enhanced 
                   thunderstorm outlooks the DDHHNN will be for
                   the earliest forecast product.

	T	   is the type of outlook (F,C,E) where F is
		   a fire weather outlook, C is a 
		   traditional Convective Outlook, and E is
                   for the Experimental Enhanced Thunderstorm
                   Outlook.  This is an optional argument and
		   defaults to "C" if not specified.

	N          only needed when T=E and specifies what product
                   issuance during the day is being dealt with:

                          ISSUANCE   BEGINNING ISSUANCE
                       N: TIME:      TIMES:
                       1   06Z       1200  1600  2000
                       2   13Z             1600  2000  0000*
                       3   17Z                   2000  0000* 0400*
                       4   20Z                         0000  0400
                       5   01Z                               0400

                                 (for "*" see ND below)

	ND         only needed when T=E and is a two digit number
                   for the next day when the forecast crosses from
                   one day into the other.  There is no way to 
                   determine the month and year from the input dat
                   files so its not possible to determine what the
                   next day is, so its a required input when the
                   date changes for N=2,3.  Providing ND in all
                   outlook types of "E" is acceptable.


The input files must have the following file name formats:

	Hail outlook		hailoutlook_DAY#_DDHHNNZ.dat
	Tornado outlook		tornoutlook_DAY#_DDHHNNZ.dat
	Wind outlook		windoutlook_DAY#_DDHHNNZ.dat
	Any severe outlook	proboutlook_DAY#_DDHHNNZ.dat
	Categorical outlook	outlook_DAY#_DDHHNNZ.dat
	Fire outlook		fireoutlook_DAY#_DDHHNNZ.dat
	Extended severe outlook	ext_svroutlook_DAY#_DDHHNNZ.dat
        Enhanced TSTM outlook   enhHHoutlook_DAY1_DDHHNNZ.dat

The input files are assumed to always exist, even if there is no
outlook of that particular type. The input files are assumed to be
in the directory $SPCDAT. This environment variable must be set for
the program to execute properly.

The output file will be named:

     - KWNSPTSDY# for the convective outlook points product,
     - KWNSPFWFD# for the fire weather outlook points product,
     - KWNSPTSET# for the experimental enhanced thunderstorm
                  outlook points product,

where # is the day number of the product. The output file 
names assume that the product will be sent using the NCEP Product 
Distribution System.
