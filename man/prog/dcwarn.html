DCWARN

    DCWARN decodes flash flood, tornado and severe thunderstorm warning 
    reports from a real-time data feed, or from a file fed to the program 
    through standard input, and writes the data to an ASCII file. 
    The program is controlled by inputs to the command line.

    The inputs are program options and the output file name or template.
    For example, for real-time data feeds:
    
	dcwarn [options] output_file

    If running the program interactively with standard input, the -c
    option must be used.  The input file must also be specified.
    For example:

	dcwarn -c YYMMDD/HHNN [other_options] output_file < input_file
    
    A template may be used to specify the output file name.  The file
    name template uses the date and time of the bulletin or report
    to replace the following characters.

	YYYY or YY	Year with or without the century
	MM		Month number
	DD		Day
	HH		Hour
	NN		Minute


     The format of the output ASCII file is as follows:

        |Type|Start_time|End_time|Orig_station|Corr_flag|Etn
	lat lon lat lon lat lon ...
        County_station_table_information_1
        County_station_table_information_2
	...
        County_station_table_information_N

     Where: Type is SVR (thunderstorm), TOR (tornado) or FFW (flash flood)
	    Start_time and End_time are full GEMPAK date/time strings
	    Orig_station is the WFO that issued the warning
	    Corr_flag is a flag indicating a correction/test.  Prior to
		release 5.11.3:
			0	Not a correction; not a test
			1	A correction; not a test
			2	Not a correction; a test
			3	A correction; a test
		From release 5.11.3, the above is still valid, but if
		there is a correction letter, then the value would be
		greater than 3:
			If it is a test, then the Corr_flag is greater
		than or equal to 256.  So subtract 256 to get the integer
		equivalent of the ASCII code of the correction letter.  If
		it is greater than 3, but less than 256, then Corr_flag is
		the equivalent of the ASCII code of the correction letter.
	    Etn is the Event Tracking Number

     Extra spaces may appear anywhere in this line of information,
     except in the first character position. The first character must
     be a bar (|).

     The lat lon pairs represent the warning polygon.  They are in degrees
     multiplied by one hundred.

     The County_station_table_information is read using the FORTRAN format
     (A8,1X,I6,1X,A32,1X,A2,1X,A2,1X,F9.2,1X,F9.2,1X,F9.2,1X,I2,1X,A20).
     The county information is the same as in the GEMPAK station tables.
