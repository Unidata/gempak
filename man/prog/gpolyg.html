GPOLYG

    GPOLYG processes gridded data to produce small craft advisory (SCA), 
    gale, storm and hurricane watch or warning polygons and Common 
    Alerting Protocol (CAP) message over the water.  To execute the 
    program properly, the grids need to be on CED projection. For grid 
    points whose wind speed exceeds specific category, they will be grouped 
    together.  The final warning polygons are generated by clipping the
    group areas with the forecast zones.

    The execution of the program is controlled by user inputs in the 
    following format,

	gpolyg
	  grid file
	  grid time
	  alias for forecast zone
	  grid area

    where grid file is in CED; grid time is in the form of 
    "080804/1200f12:080804/1200f36" for 0 to 24 h warning polygons or 
    "080804/1200f36:080804/1200f60" for 24 to 48 h watch polygons; the
    forecast zone can be "opc_atl", "opc_pac" or "tpc_atl"; and the grid 
    area can be "dset", "grid" or a pair of latitudes and longitudes covers 
    the lower left and upper right corners.

    Two outputs are generated after execution of the program: a set of
    VGF files which plot warning polygons and XML files which contain 
    vertices (latitudes/longitude) of the polygons in CAP format.

    A parameter table, poly_parm.tbl, which includes various parameters 
    specified by users.  See prolog for the usage of the parameters.
