                            PRODUCT GENERATION


Product generation provides tools to create and edit products.  Product drawing 
and editing can be overlaid on any NMAP data display.  The Vector Graphic 
File (VGF) is used to store product generation graphics and associated product
information.  Click on the icon with the low symbol and cold front next to the 
map icon in the main NMAP window to invoke product generation.  

The product generation palette is divided into controls, actions, classes, and 
objects.

The actions may act in either the "object" or "group" mode.  In object mode, 
actions are performed on objects including objects within a group.  In group
mode, actions are performed on groups only.  

Click on the desired class to activate the available objects for drawing and 
editing.  For example, clicking on the "Fronts" button will display the 
available fronts for editing under the "Objects" label.  When the "Fronts" 
class is activated, only front objects can be added, edited, deleted, etc.  
Click on the "ANY" class to perform actions on objects regardless of class.

Button hints appear in the bottom title bar below the NMAP data display window 
while in product generation.  They provide brief help when performing 
actions on objects.

The following is a brief description of each of the control functions in product
generation.

EXIT       Exit product generation.

OPEN       Open an existing VGF.  The user is presented with a file
           selection GUI to select the desired VGF.

REFRESH    Refresh the screen.

RESTORE    Restore the objects from the last session.  The user is
           asked to confirm the action.

SAVE       Save the current objects to the current VGF name. If there
           is no current file, the action performs a SAVE AS.

SAVE AS    Save the current objects to a VGF.  The user is presented
           with a file selection GUI to choose a file or enter a new name.

START/ADD  Start or add layers to product generation.  Layering allows the
LAYER	   display and editing of more than one product while in product
	   generation.  Each layer is associated with a set of objects
           and optionally a VGF file.  See the Product Generation-Layer help
	   for additional information.

OPEN PROD  Open and load a Layer Product File (LPF).  An LPF specifies layers
	   and their attributes for a product.  See the Product Generation-LPF
           help for additional information.

The following is a brief description of each product generation action.

CHNG GROUP Change all group types or a selected group type to another 
           group type.

CONN       Connect two lines or two fronts to form a single line or front.
           Select the first line/front near the end to be connected, then
           select the second line/front, and confirm the connection.
           Note that the attributes of the first line/front selected, e.g., 
           color, are inherited by the connected line/front.

COPY       Copy an object/group to a new location while leaving the
           original object. Select and then drag the object/group.

DEL        Delete a single object or a group. Select the object or 
           group for deletion and confirm.

DEL ALL    Delete all current objects.  The user is asked to confirm
           the action.

DEL OBJ    Deletes all of the same object. Select the delete object
           button, select the class, then select the object to be
           deleted. The user is asked to confirm the action.

DEL PART   Deletes part of a line or front.  Select the object; click 
           for the start of the opening, then click for the end of the 
           opening. This results in two new lines separated by the defined 
           space.

DEL PT     Delete a single vertex on a line or front.  Select the object.
           Select the point to delete.  Confirm the deletion. 

EXTRAP     Move or copy an object, or group, some distance from the original
           location. The distance is computed from the speed and direction
	   of movement and a time interval. Select the object. Enter the
	   necessary information in the dialog box. Confirm the extrapolation
	   with the left mouse button.

FLIP       Flip the direction of the pips for a front or special line type.
           Flip also switches arrow heads from one end of the line to the other.
           Select the object and confirm.

GROUP      Group objects.  Select the appropriate group type from the dialog
           box.  Select or draw the objects to put into a group.  See 
           Prod_Generation_Group help for additional details.

INC_DEC    Increment or decrement selected numeric text values.  Select the
(1234)     objects using the methods available for the multi-select action.  
           Click the middle mouse button to increment/decrement the text.  If 
           text in a station type group are selected, all numeric text in that
           group are incremented/decremented.


MOD        Modify or replace a line or front.  Select the object and add 
           vertices anywhere along the line.  See Product Generation_Modify 
           help for additional details.

MOVE       Move an object/group to a new location.  Select and then drag 
           the object/group.

MULTI      Select objects for changing attributes of more than one object.
SELECT     Objects can be selected one-by-one by clicking on them.  
           Objects can also be selected by using a drag box to define 
           a rectangular region.  Finally, a polygon may be defined to
           select objects.  To define a polygon, press the "Shift" key and
           click the left mouse button to define each polygon vertex.  A
           ghost polygon is drawn.  Click the middle mouse button to close
           the polygon and all objects within the polygon are selected.

ROTATE     Rotate a vector/software text object.  Select the object and 
           drag the indicator to the new direction.

SELECT     In object mode, select an object for changing attributes.  
           In group mode, this action is used to identify groups.  
	   Select also modifies the shape of a line/front by dragging
           vertices.

SHOW       Highlights all object groups.
ALL GROUPS

UNDO/REDO  This allows the last action to be undone/redone.  Up to ten
	   actions can be undone.

UNGROUP    Ungroup objects.  Select a group, then confirm the ungroup 
           command.

UNGROUP    Ungroup all objects.  The user is asked to confirm the action.
ALL
