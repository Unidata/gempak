MDP

  MDP generates a text file with lat-lon points from a line-enclosed area
  in a VGF file.  Only areas enclosed by scallop line are selected by this
  program.  This program is for the Mesoscale Discussion Product (MCD).

INPUT PARAMETERS

  mdp vgf_filename

  mdp		Program name
  vgf_filename	VGF file containing line element

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

  MDP scans a VGF file, finds a scallop line along with the associated 
  states and WFOs and generates a set of lat-lon points from a single line.
  The lat-lon points are in the format "%04d%04d". Latitudes are multiplied by
  100 and have G_NINT applied; longitudes have 100 subtracted from their value
  if their value exceeds 100, then are multiplied by 100 and have G_NINT applied.
  In the output text file state id's listed first, followed by "ATTN...WFO..." 
  and a list of WFO's, and finally by the lat-lon pairings.  Only six pairings 
  are listed per output text file line.  If a scallop line is not grouped with
  any states and/or WFOs only the lat-lon pairings are written out.  The execution
  stops after the programs encounters the very first scallop line even though there
  could be more lines in the VGF file.

EXAMPLE

  If the VGF file 'testfile.vgf' contained a line with the following points:
        41.766418       -122.518044
        42.707851       -122.467720
        44.064945       -121.932777
        44.591129       -120.760826
        45.477966       -119.434814
        46.121750       -117.436699
        46.573746       -114.958611
        46.324837       -114.361015
        45.830158       -113.801498
        45.148617       -113.245537
        44.289459       -112.897202
        43.804283       -112.323036
        42.986031       -111.580902
        41.616608       -112.739708
        41.016850       -114.016533
        39.825108       -115.012077
        38.889137       -114.968842
        37.886833       -114.334137
        36.475399       -114.334740
        35.717655       -115.874306
        35.557777       -117.486488
        35.708645       -118.983940
        36.962063       -121.284622
        38.641460       -122.809883
        40.430874       -123.261604
        41.344032       -123.670433

  Then the output file 'testfile.mdp' would contain:

MTZ000-UTZ000-IDZ000-NVZ000-CAZ000-ORZ000-WAZ000-
