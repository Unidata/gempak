                           STATION MODEL EDITING


The appearance of surface and upper-air station plots is controlled by two 
levels of pop-ups, the "Parm Edit" and the "Station Model Edit."  "Parm Edit" 
is invoked from the "Frame Set Definition" window ("Data" button).  When a 
observational  data type is selected, it appears on the "data source" list 
with the "edit" button enabled.  Click the "edit" button to bring up the 
"Parm Edit" pop-up.

The "Parm Edit" pop-up provides a "Filter" slider that controls the displayed 
density of stations.  The lower the filter value, the more stations displayed.  
The filter value may be varied between 0 and 2 with 0.9 the default.  For 
upper-air data, the "Parm Edit" pop-up also provides a way to choose the 
vertical coordinate and associated level.

To bring up the "Station Model Edit" window, click the station model button 
located on the "Parm Edit" pop-up.  Use the "Station Model Edit" window to 
assign parameters to station model positions, to turn positions off and on, 
and to change the colors and text of the station model.

The simplest operations on the "Station Model Edit" pop-up are associated 
with the "Clear" and "Default" buttons.  Press the "Clear" button to remove 
all parameters from the 11 positions of the station model.  Click the "Default" 
button to efficiently set up a commonly used pattern of parameters and colors.

To change a parameter in any of the 11 positions, click on the large position 
button that displays the parameter name (or the word "parm" when no parameter 
is assigned).  The background of the button turns the color currently assigned 
to that model position.  Scroll the "Parameter List" and select a parameter to 
assign to that model position.  The names that appear in the scroll list are 
names of GEMPAK parameters.  The parameters in the list are read from a table 
gemparms.tbl.

The text color for each assigned plot model position may be changed 
independently by clicking on the center of the position and selecting from 
the "Color" palette.

A plot model position with an assigned parameter may be disabled.  A disabled 
position does not appear on the final display, yet it retains the assigned 
information.  To disable a position, click on that position's tiny colored 
square so that it pops out and turns grey.  To enable a position that has an 
assigned parameter, click on the same tiny square; enabled positions have the 
tiny square colored the same as the parameter text.

Text in all positions of the station model may be varied together in size, 
font, and style using the three "Text" pop-up menus ("size," "font," and 
"style") located near the top of the "Station Model Edit" window.

To retain the changes, click "Accept" on the "Station Model Edit" pop-up and 
"LOAD" on the "Parm Edit" pop-up.
