AODT - Advanced Objective Dvorak Technique
	University of Wisconsin - Madison
	Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies

Purpose :
      Estimate intensity of a tropical cyclone using digital
      geostationary satellite infrared imagery.  
      Algorithm ONLY works for storms equal to or greater 
      than hurricane strength (T# >= 3.5)... do not use on 
      weaker systems.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

  AODT makes the appropriate calls into the CIMSS AODT library to
  calculate tropical cyclone intensity. The results are output to the
  screen as well as the history file.

REMARKS

  - Use of default history file will only provide user
    with CI value (which is actually the RAW T#).
    NO TIME AVERAGING OR OTHER ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE PERFORMED,
    and any output will only list this CI (raw T#) value.
  - Use of default history file is only possible when AODT 
    analysis is performed (ie, LIST and/or DELETE options disabled).
  - If either LIST=YES or DELETE=YES
    AODT analysis will NOT be performed on current image.
  - If a record is modified/added within an existing history
    file, all subsequent records within the history file
    will be recalculated using the new/modified AODT record.
  - If DATE is provided in conjunction with LIST *AND*
    DELETE keywords, DATE will apply ONLY to the DELETE
    keyword (and a LIST will be drawn/listed for
    the entire history file (defaults)).


EXAMPLES

  aodt -c nmap2.cpf IR_19990915_1045

	- performs the AODT analysis on the image file IR_19990915_1045
          (located in the current working directoy) using the latitude and
          longitude in the cpf file "nmap2.cpf". The history file will be
	  the default history file "AODTDUMP.AODT".

  aodt -c 29.4,-78.8 -y $AODTHIST/floyd $SAT/GOES-E/TropAtl_8km/IR/IR_19990915_1045

	- performs the AODT analysis on the image file IR_19990915_1045 
	  (located in the directoy "$SAT/GOES-E/TropAtl_8km/IR") using a 
	  latitude of 29.4 and longitude of -78.8. The history file will 
	  be saved to the file "$AODTHIST/floyd".
