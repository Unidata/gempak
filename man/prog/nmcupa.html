NMCSND decodes upper-air data in NMC archive format and
writes it to a GEMPAK sounding data file.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION                                                             
                                                                                
    NMCSND decodes snounding observations in NMC Office
    Note 29/124 format and writes it to the GEMPAK snounding
    file given by SNFILE.  AREA is entered as the
    southwestern and northeastern corner points of the
    region over which stations will be included.

    The NMC raw data file name is entered by specifying SNEFIL.
    The file may contain either EBCIDC or ASCII data.

    NMCSND will create an GEMPAK snounding file if SNFILE
    does not already exist using TIMSTN to set the number
    of times and stations to included in the file.
