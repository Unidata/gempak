                    GPMXPLT

This utility uses the specified GAREA, DEVICE and PROJECTION and
computes a new GAREA that will fill the device, leaving the original
GAREA in the center.  The new GAREA is obtained from the resulting
gemglb.nts file.  This utility is used to help fill in the horizontal
gaps that can result in rendering the image to a device, whether it is
a GIF image for a postscript image.  The utility is used in surface map
and watch box plotting routines at the AWC.

Typically, a center point or geographic area of coordinates is passed
to the GPMXPLT program through a shell script.  Since output is kept in
the resulting gemglb.nts file, additional applications such as GDCNTR,
SFMAP, GPMAP, etc. can reference the gemglb.nts file for the GAREA,
DEVICE and PROJECTION information.  In other words, don't specify the 
GAREA, DEVICE, or PROJ command in the subsequent GEMPAK application(s).

Examle use vis csh:
gpmxplt << EOF > /dev/null
   GAREA + $area
   PROJ = $proj
   DEVICE = $device
   PANEL = 0
   R<CR>
   Exit
EOF
gpmap << EOF1 > /dev/null
# Don't mention GAREA, DEVICE, or PROJ.  These were set up by gpmxplt
   MAP = ...
   CLEAR = Y
   ...
R<CR>
   Exit
EOF1
