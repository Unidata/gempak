DCWTCH

    DCWTCH decodes tornado and severe thunderstorm watch box reports 
    and watch status reports from a real-time data feed, or from a
    file fed to the program through standard input, and writes the data 
    to an ASCII file.  The program is controlled by inputs to the 
    command line.

    The inputs are program options and the output file name or template.
    For example, for real-time data feeds:
    
	dcwtch [options] output_file

    If running the program interactively with standard input, the -c
    option must be used.  The input file must also be specified.
    For example:

	dcwtch -c YYMMDD/HHNN [other_options] output_file < input_file
    
    A template may be used to specify the output file name.  The file
    name template uses the date and time of the bulletin or report
    to replace the following characters.

	YYYY or YY	Year with or without the century
	MM		Month number
	DD		Day
	HH		Hour
	NN		Minute


     The format of the output ASCII file is as follows:

     |Type|Start_time|End_time|Watch_number|Corr_flag|Cancel_flag
	     Lat1    Lon1
	     Lat2    Lon2
	     Lat3    Lon3
	     Lat4    Lon4

     Where: Type is TS (thunderstorm), TN (tornado) , RP (replaced)
 	    	or ST (status) 
	    Start_time and End_time are full GEMPAK date/time strings
	    Watch_number is the number assigned to the watch
	    Corr_flag is a flag indicating a correction (0 or 1)
	    Cancel_flag is a flag indicating a cancellation (0 or 1),
		or, for type ST, the number of points which follow

     Extra spaces may appear anywhere in this line of information,
     except in the first character position.  The first character must
     be a bar (|).

     The latitude and longitude values are read using the FORTRAN
     format (2F9.2).  Types TS and TN will always have four points;
     the number of points for type ST may vary.
