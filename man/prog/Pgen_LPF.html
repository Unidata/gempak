			     Layer Product Files	



I.  Functionality

A layer product file (LPF) specifies product generation layer attributes.   
When an LPF is selected, layers and their associated attributes are read from 
the LPF and automatically loaded into product generation allowing layer 
operations.  A maximum of ten layers can be specified in an LPF.  See the 
Product Generation-Layer Help for information regarding layer functionality.

The following layer attributes can be specified in an LPF:

	A.  Layer name
	B.  VGF name
	C.  Group name
	D.  Layer toggle, i.e., on/off  
	E.  Color mode, i.e., all colors or monochrome display 
	F.  Monochrome color number 
	G.  Fill toggle, i.e., on/off

The layer toggle, color mode, monochrome color number and fill toggle specify 
the layer appearance when the layer is not active.  These attributes appear in 
the "Layer Control" GUI.  If a VGF is specified, it is opened for the layer.  
If it does not exist, an empty VGF is created in the local directory and opened 
for the layer.  The group name is the default group associated with the layer 
that appears when the "GROUP" action is invoked.  

II.  Operation

Click the "OPEN PROD" button on the main product generation palette to open an
LPF.  The "Open Layer Product File" GUI is invoked allowing the user to select 
an LPF file in a similar fashion as selecting VGFs and SPFs.  Click on the 
desired directory and file in the GUI's respective scroll lists.  Upon clicking 
the "Open" button, the layers and attributes specified in the LPF are loaded 
into product generation.  The "Layer Control" GUI is invoked allowing layer 
operations.   

The directories that appear in the "Open Layer Product File" GUI are specified 
in the table: $GEMTBL/nmap/lpf.tbl.  

III.  Layer Product File Format

The LPF file has a format similar to the Stored Procedure File (SPF).  It is 
an editable text file containing a set of key words followed by their values 
for each layer.   The file $GEMTBL/pgen/example.lpf is an example of an LPF 
with a complete description of the format.
