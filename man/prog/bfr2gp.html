PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
 
    BFR2GP transfers data in Jack Woollen's BUFR format to GEMPAK
    sounding and surface data files.  The input BUFR file must be a
    blocked Jack Woollen type BUFR file.  Note that both a GEMPAK
    sounding file and/or a surface file may be created by this program.

    Since the BUFR file must be blocked, Jack Woollen has provided
    a script named blkunblk to block a file that is not blocked.
    To transfer a Jack Woollen BUFR file from another computer, first
    unblock it on the original machine, then transfer the unblocked
    file.  Finally, reblock the file on the receiving computer
    before running BFR2GP.

    The name of the Jack Woollen BUFR file is entered in <a href=../parm/snefil.html>SNEFIL</a>.
    Following the name of the BUFR file is the name of the Woollen
    table file that was used to generate the BUFR file.  The two
    file names are separated by |.  The table file must be included
    for the decoding to work.  BUFR table files are ASCII text files.

    If <a href=../parm/sffsrc.html>SFFSRC</a> is not blank, only data having the message type (BUFR
    Table A entry) specified by <a href=../parm/sffsrc.html>SFFSRC</a> will be read.  If <a href=../parm/sffsrc.html>SFFSRC</a> is
    blank, data will be extracted from all message types.  The
    data may be further restricted by entering <a href=../parm/sffsrc.html>SFFSRC</a> according to
    the following form:

      <a href=../parm/type.html>TYPE</a> | CAT1=v1,v2,v3,...vN; CAT2=v1,...vN; ... CATn=v1,...

    where each CATn gives the name of a BUFR parameter mnemonic, and
    each vN gives a permissible value of the BUFR parameter.  A BUFR
    message will be accepted if all of the values taken by the given
    parameters match one of the listed values.  If a value is not in
    the list, the message is rejected.  For example, suppose the
    specification for parameter CNT is CNT=2,3,7.  The message is
    rejected if CNT has a value other than 2,3,7 anywhere in the BUFR
    message.


    The output GEMPAK sounding data file name is entered in <a href=../parm/snoutf.html>SNOUTF</a>.
    The output GEMPAK surface data file name is entered in <a href=../parm/sfoutf.html>SFOUTF</a>.

    Conversion of the data is driven by the contents of conversion
    table files.  The names of these files are entered in <a href=../parm/snprmf.html>SNPRMF</a> and
    <a href=../parm/sfprmf.html>SFPRMF</a>.  There must be a conversion table file for sounding data
    and one for surface data.  If no sounding data is requested, then
    only a surface data conversion table is needed.  However, when
    only sounding data is to be processed, a surface conversion table
    file is still needed for some two to eleven identification, time,
    and location parameters.  These parameters are described in the
    following table:

      GEMPAK name     Description     Units/type     Required?

       STID           Identifier       CHARACTER        NO
       BLOK           Block number     INTEGER          NO
       STNM           Station number   INTEGER          NO
       SLAT           Latitude         Degrees          YES
       SLON           Longitude        Degrees          YES
       SELV           Elevation        Meters           NO
       YYYY           Year (4 digit)   INTEGER          NO
       MMMM           Month            INTEGER          NO
       DDDD           Day              INTEGER          NO
       HHHH           Hour             INTEGER          NO
       NNNN           Minute           INTEGER          NO
       TOFF*          Offset time      Seconds          NO
       TADD**         Offset time      Seconds          NO

             * TOFF is used in computing observation time.
	    ** TADD is used in computing actual station time.
	       Either TADD or TOFF, but not both may be given.

    The time associated with a station may be determined in one of
    three ways:

	1)  Directly, using YYYY, MMMM, DDDD, HHHH, NNNN.  If the
	    data time need only be known to the nearest hour, then
            omit NNNN.  TOFF and TADD are ignored, and the obs
	    time is set to zero.

	    If NNNN is available, the time may be rounded to the
	    nearest fraction of an hour as determined by the input
	    for the factor and term associated with NNNN (see
	    below).  For example, if the factor for NNNN is
	    30, the data is rounded to the nearest half hour.  The
	    values for the conversion factor and term are used as
	    follows to compute the rounded minute:

	    min = F * NEAREST_INT ( ( NNNN + T ) / F )
	    IF ( min >= 60 ) min = 0
	    IF ( min < 0 ) min = 0

	    where F is the factor and T is the term.  Note that the
	    term serves as an offset (usually zero).  If F = 1. for
	    NNNN, no rounding is done.

	2)  Indirectly, from the BUFR block time, with the obs
            time set using TOFF, if it is given.

	3)  Indirectly, from the BUFR block time plus the offset
	    time specified as TADD.  The obs time is set to 0.

    If the block number (BLOK) is present, it is added to the
    station number (STNM) to form the GEMPAK integer station number.
    Therefore, the block number must be multiplied by a factor that
    is large enough to yield the correct number of digits for the
    station number (usually either five or six).  The use of the
    conversion factors is described below.

    If no block number is present, the station number alone is used
    for the GEMPAK integer station identifier.  If no STID is present,
    the character station ID defaults to a blank.  If neither a station
    number or a character ID is present, a sequence number is assigned
    to each observation to serve as a station number, and the character
    station ID is blank.

    Use the conversion factor and term to convert to the above units
    if the corresponding BUFR parameters are in different units (see
    below).  These parameters must always appear first, in any order,
    in the surface data conversion table file, whose name is entered
    in <a href=../parm/sfprmf.html>SFPRMF</a>.  This information is stored in the header for the
    station in the GEMPAK file; therefore, these parameters do not
    count toward the limit of MMPARM (usually 40) parameters per GEMPAK
    file.

    The conversion table files contain four columns of data.  The
    four columns are:

     BUFR name  GEMPAK name  Conversion Factor  Conversion Term

    The BUFR name entry comes from the Jack Woollen BUFR table and
    corresponds to a TABLE B ENTRY.  The GEMPAK name is the four-
    character name used for that parameter in GEMPAK.  The conversion
    factor and term are used to do unit conversions or linear trans-
    formations of the data before storage to the GEMPAK file.  The
    GEMPAK value is calculated as follows:

			g = b * F + T

    where g is the GEMPAK value, b is the unpacked BUFR value, F is
    the conversion factor, and T is the conversion term.  For no
    conversion at all, set F = 1.0 and T = 0.0.  The values in each
    row of the table may be separated by spaces or tabs.  If a row
    begins with !, that row is ignored.  Comments may be entered into
    the table using this feature.

    If a surface parameter is replicated in the BUFR file (one param-
    eter name stands for several stored values), its values can be
    transfered to the GEMPAK surface data file.  To accomplish this,
    make an entry in the surface conversion table file for each value
    of the replicated parameter.  These entries will have the same
    BUFR name but different GEMPAK names.  There does not have to
    be an entry for all replications.  But, there must be enough
    entries to cover the ones desired in sequential order.  For
    example, if only the third replicated value is needed, the first
    two must be transfered anyway.

    A backslash (\) may be placed at the beginning of an otherwise
    blank line in the conversion table file.  This triggers a
    separate READ operation on the BUFR file for the parameters
    listed after it.

    The packing information is computed from the information in the
    Jack Woollen BUFR table file, taking into account any linear
    transformation of the data.

    By default the sounding file is a merged sounding data file.  An
    unmerged file can be created by specifying a list of observed
    parameter names in the following order:

		PRES HGHT TEMP DWPT DRCT SPED LFLG (or LCAT)

    LFLG will be checked to make the following correspondences:

	INTEGER VALUE		DATA <a href=../parm/type.html>TYPE</a>

	    64			Surface
	    16			Tropopause level
	     8			Maximum wind level
	    32			Mandatory level
	     4			Significant temperature level
	     2			Significant wind level


    LCAT will be checked to make the following correspondences:

	INTEGER VALUE		DATA <a href=../parm/type.html>TYPE</a>

	     0			Surface
	     5			Tropopause level
	     1			Mandatory level
	     2			Significant temperature level
	   3 or 4		Significant wind level

    These are Office Note 29 categories.

    The various data groups will all be placed in the same GEMPAK
    sounding file.  GEMPAK programs that process or display sounding
    data will be able to merge these data partitions.

    <a href=../parm/timstn.html>TIMSTN</a> specifies the maximum number of date/times and the maximum
    number of stations to be stored in the GEMPAK file(s).  If only
    one number is entered for <a href=../parm/timstn.html>TIMSTN</a>, then a ship data surface file
    is created, allowing each report to have a separate time stamp.
    If a sounding file is being created at the same time, this number
    will be used for the number of stations, the number of times will
    default to 24.

    <a href=../parm/area.html>AREA</a> specifies the lat/lon bounds of the area over which data is
    to be accepted.  Data outside of these lat/lon bounds on a CED
    projection will not be included.  If <a href=../parm/area.html>AREA</a> is blank, at lat/lon
    values are accepted.

    <a href=../parm/dattim.html>DATTIM</a> specifies a time range over which data is to be accepted
    for transfer into the GEMPAK file.  It is entered as two complete
    GEMPAK times separated by -.  If all times are to be accepted,
    enter a blank.


EXAMPLES
 
    1.  Create sounding and surface data files from the BUFR output
	file name 950612.bufr containing hourly profiles and surface
	data from a 48-h forecast.  Subset the area and time.  Extract
	only ETACLS0 data.

	<a href=../parm/snefil.html>SNEFIL</a> = 950612.bufr|eta_bufr.table
	<a href=../parm/sffsrc.html>SFFSRC</a> = ETACLS0
	<a href=../parm/snoutf.html>SNOUTF</a> = 950612.snd
	<a href=../parm/sfoutf.html>SFOUTF</a> = 950612.sfc
	<a href=../parm/snprmf.html>SNPRMF</a> = snbuf_emc.conv
	<a href=../parm/sfprmf.html>SFPRMF</a> = sfbuf_emc.conv
	<a href=../parm/area.html>AREA</a>   = 30;-100;50;-60
	<a href=../parm/dattim.html>DATTIM</a> = 950612/0600-950613/0400
	<a href=../parm/timstn.html>TIMSTN</a> = 49/500

    2.  Create only a sounding file from prepbufr input.  The
	station location information is in BUFR parameters defined
	in stn_conv.tbl.  Subset the area, but not the time.
	Extract data only from the ADPUPA message types.

	<a href=../parm/snefil.html>SNEFIL</a> = prepbufr|prepbufr.table
	<a href=../parm/sffsrc.html>SFFSRC</a> = ADPUPA
	<a href=../parm/snoutf.html>SNOUTF</a> = pbfr.snd
	<a href=../parm/sfoutf.html>SFOUTF</a> =
	<a href=../parm/snprmf.html>SNPRMF</a> = snd_conv.tbl
	<a href=../parm/sfprmf.html>SFPRMF</a> = stn_conv.tbl
	<a href=../parm/area.html>AREA</a>   = 10;-120;75;-60
	<a href=../parm/dattim.html>DATTIM</a> =
	<a href=../parm/timstn.html>TIMSTN</a> = 49/500

    3.  Create only a surface file from prepbufr input.  Do not
	subset area or time.  Do not restrict the message type.

	<a href=../parm/snefil.html>SNEFIL</a> = prepbufr|prepbufr.table
	<a href=../parm/sffsrc.html>SFFSRC</a> =
	<a href=../parm/snoutf.html>SNOUTF</a> =
	<a href=../parm/sfoutf.html>SFOUTF</a> = pbfr.sfc
	<a href=../parm/snprmf.html>SNPRMF</a> =
	<a href=../parm/sfprmf.html>SFPRMF</a> = sfc_conv.tbl
	<a href=../parm/area.html>AREA</a>   =
	<a href=../parm/dattim.html>DATTIM</a> =
	<a href=../parm/timstn.html>TIMSTN</a> = 49/500
