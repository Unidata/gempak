GPTCWW generates the track error watch/warn plot for the TPC, using
breakpoint information contained in a VGF file.


INPUT PARAMETERS
 
    <a href=../parm/strmid.html>STRMID</a>    Storm id/Adv num/Device/Num fcst days/Text/Track/Sz1;Sz2/Lt1;Lt2/L
 
 
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
 
    GPTCWW will plot the track error watch/warn plot for each tropical
    system specified.  The system(s) to be plotted may be specified in
    one of two ways:

	(1) A storm identifier and advisory number may be explicitly
	    specified using the <a href=../parm/strmid.html>STRMID</a> parameter.

	(2) Storm identifiers and advisory numbers may be gotten by
	    checking the storm history file against the contents of
	    the storm advisory directory.  Only the latest advisory
	    for each storm in the directory (which is not found in the
	    history file) will be processed.  This method of running is
	    specified by leaving the storm id and/or advisory number
	    blank in the <a href=../parm/strmid.html>STRMID</a> parameter, and is the default mode.
	    See the help for <a href=../parm/strmid.html>STRMID</a> for further details.

    The track error watch/warn plot displays the current location and
    the forecasted track for the tropical system.  It also shows the
    track error envelope.  Active hurricane watches and warnings and
    tropical storm watches and warnings, if any, will be displayed.
    The watch/warning information is gotten from a local VG file of
    TCA elements created in product generation.

    The program can generate XW, GIF, or PostScript files, depending
    on the value of the third field of the <a href=../parm/strmid.html>STRMID</a> parameter.  The
    default is GIF files.  See the help for <a href=../parm/strmid.html>STRMID</a> for further details.

    The program will display either a 3 day or a 5 day forecast,
    depending on the value of the fourth field of the <a href=../parm/strmid.html>STRMID</a>
    parameter.  See the help for <a href=../parm/strmid.html>STRMID</a> for further details.

    (GPTCWW does not use the fifth field of the <a href=../parm/strmid.html>STRMID</a> parameter.)

 
EXAMPLES
 
    1.  Use the history file to determine which new advisories are to
	be plotted.  GIF files will be created.  A 5 day forecast
	is displayed.

	<a href=../parm/strmid.html>STRMID</a>	 =

    2.  Plot the graphic for advisory number 8 of storm al892001.
        Display the graphic in XW only.  A 5 day forecast is displayed.

	<a href=../parm/strmid.html>STRMID</a>	 =  al892001/8/xw

    3.  Plot the graphic for advisory number 1 of storm al882001 in an
	XW window.  A 3 day forecast is displayed.

	<a href=../parm/strmid.html>STRMID</a>	 =  al882001/1/xw/3

    4.  Plot the graphic for advisory number 20 of storm ep1900 (which
	could also have been specified as ep192000).  A GIF file will be
        created.  A 5 day forecast is displayed.

	<a href=../parm/strmid.html>STRMID</a>   =  ep1900/20/gf

    5.  Plot the graphic for advisory number 30 of storm al132004.
        Display the graphic in XW only.  Display a 5 day forecast.
        Do not plot the forecasted track.  Have cyclone's forecasted
        position up to and including 72 hours marked in size 3, and
        beyond that marked in size 1.2

        <a href=../parm/strmid.html>STRMID</a>	=  al132004/30/xw/5//N/3;1.2

    6.  Plot the graphic for advisory number 10 of storm al172004.
        Display the graphic in XW only.  Display a 5 day forecast.
        Plot the forecasted track up to and including 72 hours with
	long-dashed red line of width 4, and beyond 72 hours with
	short-dashed magenta line of width 1.  Do not plot the
        scale legend box.

        <a href=../parm/strmid.html>STRMID</a>	=  al172004/10/xw/5////5;2/4;1/2;7/N
