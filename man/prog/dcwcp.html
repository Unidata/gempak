DCWCP

    DCWCP decodes tornado and severe thunderstorm Watch Corner Points
    (WCP) reports from a real-time data feed, or from a file fed to
    the program through standard input, and writes the data 
    to an ASCII file.  The program is controlled by inputs to the 
    command line.

    The inputs are program options and the output file name or template.
    For example, for real-time data feeds:
    
	dcwcp [options] output_file

    If running the program interactively with standard input, the -c
    option must be used.  The input file must also be specified.
    For example:

	dcwcp -c YYMMDD/HHNN [other_options] output_file < input_file
    
    A template may be used to specify the output file name.  The file
    name template uses the date and time of the bulletin or report
    to replace the following characters.

	YYYY or YY	Year with or without the century
	MM		Month number
	DD		Day
	HH		Hour
	NN		Minute


     The format of the output ASCII file is as follows:

     |Type|Issue_Time|Start_time|End_time|Watch_number|Points
	     Lat1    Lon1
	     Lat2    Lon2
	     Lat3    Lon3
	     Lat4    Lon4

     Where: Type is TSM (thunderstorm), TOR (tornado) , NA (No watches
 	    	currently active)
	    Issue_Time, Start_time and End_time are full GEMPAK
		date/time strings (YYYYMMDD/HHNN)
	    Watch_number is the number assigned to the watch
	    Points is the number of lat/lon pairs which follow

     Extra spaces may appear anywhere in this line of information,
     except in the first character position.  The first character must
     be a bar (|).

     The latitude and longitude values are read using the FORTRAN
     format (2F9.2).  Currently, there are 7 points but this may not
     always be the case.
