 SIGAVGF

    SIGAVGF reads a High Level (SWH) or Mid Level (SWM) Significant
    Weather ASCII file and encodes the information into a VG file.

 INPUT PARAMETERS

    SIGAVGF  YYMMDD/HHNN FF infile.name


    SIGAVGF        Program name
    YYMMDD/HHNN    GEMPAK date/time
                      YY - year, MM - month, DD - day, HH - hour,
                      NN - minutes
    FF             Valid forecast hour (must be 18 or 24)
    infile.name    Input file name

 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    SIGAVGF reads a single ASCII file using the UKMET browsable dataset
    format (see "Representing WAFS Significant Weather (SIGWX) Data in
    BUFR", version 2.3, November 2004, for documentation).  The output
    VG files use the following naming conventions, where date/time,
    forecast hour and data type define the file name:

                ???_YYYYMMDDHH_FF_final.vgf for high level SIGWX files
                m???_YYYYMMDDHH_FF_final.vgf for mid level SIGWX files

   where:
        YYYY - the year including the century
          MM - the month
          DD - the day
          HH - the hour
	  FF - the valid forecast hour (18 or 24)

         ??? - cld - CLOUD (Embedded cumulonimbus)
               cat - CAT (Clear air turbulence)
	       frt - FRONTS (Frontal systems)
               jet - JETS (Jetstreams)
               trp - TROP (Tropopause height)
               vts - V_T_S (Volcanoes, Storms, Radiation)

        m??? - cld - M-CLOUD (SWM cloud, in-cloud icing and turbulence)
               cat - M-CAT (SWM Clear air turbulence)
	       frt - M-FRONTS (SWM Frontal systems)
               jet - M-JETS (SWM Jetstreams)
               trp - M-TROP (SWM Tropopause height)
               vts - V_T_S (Volcanoes, Storms, Radiation)

   The ??? names above apply to high level SIGWX VG files.  For mid
   level files, each ??? is prefixed by an "m", so that, for example,
   the mid level FRONTS VG file is mfrt_YYYYMMDDHH_FF_final.vgf.  The
   output VG files are created locally. 
 
   The infile.name is the name of the ASCII file to be decoded.  If the
   input file is not given, then the program looks locally for a file
   named SIGWXHI.txt or SIGWXMID.txt, in that order.  If none of these
   files can be found, an error is displayed.



 VG FILE DIFFERENCES 

   There are known instances where if there are three hash marks in a 
   row on a jet, the middle hash mark may be placed on top of the right 
   hash mark.  Also, the labels for clouds and turbulence are placed in 
   the center of each area. These issues will be fixed at a later date.

 ERROR MESSAGES 


   [SIGAVGF -1]  Forecast hour not found on the command line.
   [SIGAVGF -2]  Valid hour must be 18 or 24, not !AS
   [SIGAVGF -3]  ASCII file !AS failed to open.
   [SIGAVGF -4]  ASCII file !AS failed to close.
   [SIGAVGF -5]  VG file !AS failed to open.
