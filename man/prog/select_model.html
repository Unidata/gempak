                                SELECT MODEL


The "Select Model" pop-up is used to select the desired model metafile for 
display.

This pop-up is found under the "File" pull-down menu and may be invoked by 
choosing "Model list," by pressing the right mouse button, or by typing CTRL-M.

Models available in the database appear as buttons in the panel.  Click on 
the desired model.  A list of the metafiles for that model appear in the 
scroll list.  To select the desired metafile, click in the scroll list, then 
click the "Select" button.  A list of products for the selected metafile will 
appear in the "Select Group" panel.

Click on the "Update" button to get the latest available metafiles in the 
database.
