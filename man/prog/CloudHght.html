                                 CLOUD HEIGHT


This function estimates cloud top height using a sounding and a satellite 
derived infrared temperature.  Click on the "cloud height" icon to invoke this
function.  The sounding is either retrieved from a sounding data file or from
a table file.  The table file, $GEMTBL/config/stdsnd.tbl contains a standard
atmospheric profile.  The contents of this file may be modified for Nmap use
after being copied to a local directory.

Temperature and height are calculated corresponding to the cursor position, or 
alternatively, a minimum temperature or mode temperature may be used to retrieve
the height for an area surrounding the cursor.  Multiple heights are listed if 
the same cloud top temperature crosses the sounding more than once.

Click on the options button to specify the type of retrieval, units, and 
whether a sounding data set (Closest Station) or sounding table (Standard 
Atmosphere) is used.


    CLOSE    Close the cloud height window.

    OPTIONS  Display cloud height options.  Such as: distance, temperature, 
             height, type of sounding, search radius and pixel selection 
             information.

    TAKE CONTROL  Regain use of the cloud height function after using 
                  product generation.


Under the OPTIONS button, these choices are available:


    DISTANCE  The distance of the pixel to the closest sounding station.  
              Units are kilometers, miles or nautical miles.

    TEMPERATURE  The temperature can be displayed in Celsius or Kelvin.

    HEIGHT  The cloud height can be displayed in feet or meters.

    TYPE OF DATA  The source type for the sounding.  "Closest Station" 
                  specifies the use of the nearest sounding in a sounding 
                  data file.  "Standard Atmosphere" specifies using the 
                  sounding defined in the table file, stdsnd.tbl.

    SEARCH RADIUS  The maximum search radius that is used for finding a station.

    PIXEL SELECTION  Use a single pixel or an area surrounding the cursor.

    PIXEL RADIUS  Size of search area around the pixel area.  The maximum 
                  allowed is 100.

    PIXEL VALUE  The maximum or mode pixel value.

    DEFAULTS  Set the cloud height options to the default values.
