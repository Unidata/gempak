		 	  Product Generation Layering


I.  Functionality

Layering allows the display and editing of more than one product while in
product generation.  This function facilitates creating more than one product
at a time or using multiple products as guides in creating a new product.
Each layer is associated with a set of objects and optionally may be 
associated with a VGF.  Only one layer can be selected to be active at a 
time.  When a layer is active, all product generation functions can operate 
on it, whereas non-active layers can only be displayed.  The active layer 
is displayed in full color with all of its fills applied.  Non-active layers 
may be toggled on or off, displayed in full color or a user-selected 
mono-color, and displayed with fills turned on or off.  Up to 10 layers can 
be present in product generation. 

A GUI allows the user to easily switch which layer is active.  Product
generation actions are terminated when switching between layers.  For example,
if an object is being drawn and the active layer is changed, the object is
not drawn.

Layers and their attributes can be pre-specified and loaded into product 
generation using a Layer Product File (LPF).  See the Layer Product Files help
for additional information.

II. Operation

Click the "START LAYER" button in the "Controls" section of the product
generation palette ("pgpalette") to invoke layering.  The "Layer Control" 
and "Layer Name" GUIs are activated.  Enter a layer name in the
"Layer Name" text window to specify a layer name and click "Accept" to
change the default layer name.  To add more layers, click the "ADD LAYER" 
button on the product generation palette.  The "Layer Control" GUI expands
vertically each time a layer is added, adding another row of buttons that
correspond to the new layer.

The "Layer Control" GUI remains visible while in product layering mode.  This
GUI controls which layer is active and the display attributes of the 
non-active layers by using its three columns of buttons.  

The first column button, which lists the layer name, controls which layer is 
active.  Click this button to select the desired active layer.  The active 
layer is indicated by the button that is highlighted.  When a layer is active,
all of its colors and fill patterns are displayed and all product generation
actions can operate on its objects.  A particular VGF file may be associated
with a layer by opening an existing VGF or saving a VGF while the layer is
active.  A group type may be associated with a layer by selecting it with
the "GROUP" action while the layer is active.  In this way, each layer may
have its own group type when active.  

The second column button is a checkbox (a toggle mechanism) that controls 
whether elements on the layer are displayed when the layer is not active.  A 
filled checkbox indicates that the layer is set to be on, whereas 
an empty checkbox indicates the layer is turned off.  Elements on layers with a 
checkbox set on will be displayed even when their layer is not the currently 
active layer.  Layers set to off will not be displayed unless their layer is 
the active layer.  Elements on the active layer are always displayed even if 
the checkbox is set to off.

The third column button controls whether a layer is displayed as monochrome, 
the monochrome color choice and whether its fill patterns are visible when 
the layer is not active.  Clicking this button invokes the "Layer Display" 
GUI.  Click the "Mono Color" and "Fill" buttons to turn on/off mono-color and 
fill, respectively.   To specify the color for mono-color display, click the 
color square.  Then select the desired color from the "Color Palette" GUI.  
The third column button label and color indicate the layer display state when 
not active.  The "A" and "M" before the "/" indicate all colors and mono-color
display, respectively.  The "F" and "N" after the "/" indicate fills shown
and fills not shown, respectively.  The button color indicates the mono-color
color choice for the layer.  

The "All On" and "All Off" buttons are shortcut mechanisms which turn all the
layer checkboxes on and off respectively.

Additionally hotkeys provide a way to switch layers from the keyboard instead
of clicking on the layer buttons in the Layer Control GUI.  Keys 1..0 switch 
the active layer to layers 1 - 10.  The key combination of Shift and 1..0 
switch the active layer to layers 11 - 20.

The "Edit Name" button on the "Layer Control" GUI invokes the "Layer Name"
GUI which allows the modification of a layer name.  The maximum number of 
layer name characters is eight.

Clicking the "Exit" button on the "Layer Control" GUI terminates layering.  
If changes have been made to any layer objects without saving them to a 
VGF, then the user is prompted to save the changes to a VGF.  Upon exit all 
layer objects are combined and made active.
