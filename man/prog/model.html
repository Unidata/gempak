                     MODEL DATA SOUNDINGS


The MODEL SOUNDING SELECTION window allows the user to select the
source of the gridded data set using the "Select Model" button. The
data set choices are defined in the $NAWIPS/tables/nsharp/nsharp_models.tbl
table and reference the datatype.tbl template/aliases. Any model file may
be used by choosing the "BROWSE" option in the model file list.

The sounding location is entered using a valid GPOINT specification.
The point for which the model sounding is computed can be (1) entered
directly into the text box, (2) obtained by positioning the mouse pointer
in the provided map and clicking mouse button 1 to set the point, or
(3) obtained from the Cursor Point File (CPF).

A readout is provided for the current mouse position in addition to the
sounding location. The interactive selection map can be toggled using
the radio buttons provided to either specify the GPOINT value as a
latitude/longitude pair, or the closest surface station.

The third radio button option allows the user to select the contents of
the Cursor Point File (CPF). The CPF contains a location obtained from
saving the cursor position from NMAP2. When this radio button is
selected, the latitude/longitude pair from the CPF is displayed in 
the text box.

After selecting the grid file(s), the available times within the 
file(s) will be displayed in the "Model times" list. Multiple
files may be selected. A single time or multiple times may be selected.

The map AREA may be set using the predefined map regions, while
ZOOMing is accomplished through the use of a rubber band box.
UNZOOMing will restore the image to the current AREA.

Select "Cancel" to close the sounding selection window without
changing the current sounding display, or choose "OK" to
plot the sounding once the desired grid time and location are 
selected.
