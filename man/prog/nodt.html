NODT - Objective Dvorak Technique
	University of Wisconsin - Madison
	Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies

Purpose :
      Estimate intensity of a tropical cyclone using digital
      geostationary satellite infrared imagery.  
      Algorithm ONLY works for storms equal to or greater 
      than hurricane strength (T# >= 3.5)... do not use on 
      weaker systems.
                                                                       

Usage: 	nodt [options] image_filename

  OPTIONS:

 opt    value   description

  -a	typ/fn	(McIDAS keyword option "AUTO")
		Allow for totally automated operation of the ODT.
		May be used in conjunction with -v option.
		"typ" may be:
		typ=1:TPC WTNT4? or WTPZ3? DISCUSSION file.
		typ=2:JTWC WTPN3? TROPICAL CYCLONE WARNING file.
		and "fn" is the file (default "AUTOFIX").
		(NOTE: no whitespace allowed in "typ/fn" string)

  -c	fn	NMAP2 cursor point file filename (must be *.cpf)
                containing storm center location
       -or-     -OR-
      clat,clon Storm center location in the format "clat,clon" 
		(NOTE: clon negative west, no whitespace allowed)

  -d   date1/time1/date2/time2
		(McIDAS keyword option "DATE")
		Range of dates/times desired (same format as history file)
                Enter "date" as YrMonDay (e.g. 97OCT05)
                Enter "time" as HHMMSS   (e.g. 131500)
                Defaults :
                  LIST (-l option):
                    date1/time1 : first record
                    date2/time2 : last record
                  DELETE (-e option):
                    date1/time1 : no defaults, must specify
                    date2/time2 : date1/time1
		No whitespace allowed in "date1/time1/date2/time2" string.

  -e     -      Allows for manual deletion of a date or a range of dates
	        (use in conjuction with -d option). No option value such 
		as YES or NO.

  -h	 -      Display this help message.

  -l	 -   	(McIDAS keyword option "LIST")
	        List contents of history file (-y fn option) to text window. 
		No option value such as YES or NO.
	    

  -m	"ATL"	(McIDAS keyword option "DOMAIN")
	-or-	Atlantic or West Pacific T# and CI intensity estimate and 
	"PAC"	related pressure/wind value.  For East Pacific, user will 
		have to decide which domain is correct to use for pressure.
		(default ATL)

  -o	fn      (McIDAS keyword option "OUTPUT")
		For -l option only, output to the file "fn" (default 
		ODTDUMP.ASC), otherwise to the screen.

  -r	"yes"	(McIDAS keyword option "RULE48")
	-or-    Turn off application of special "first 48 hour rule" 
	"no"    which subtracts 0.5 from the Raw T# (default=YES).

  -s	scene	(functionality of McIDAS keyword option "OVER")
	        Allow user to manually override ODT scene identification 
	        and/or automated center positioning.  May be utilized 
	    	with -a option, if desired.  (default=let pgm determine).
		Valid scene types:
		"EYE"   - CLEAR EYE
		"EYEL"  - VERY LARGE CLEAR EYE
		"EYES"  - SMALL EYE (pinhole)
		"EYER"  - RAGGED EYE
		"DRYR"  - DRY SLOT/RAGGED EYE
		"EMBC"  - EMBEDDED CENTER
		"CDO"   - CDO
		"SHEAR" - SHEAR

  -w	"yes"	(McIDAS keyword option "WIND")
	-or-    List intensity units in terms of wind speed (knots) 
	"no"    instead of MSLP.  Used with LIST or with ODA analysis 
	    	output (default=NO).

  -y	fn	(McIDAS keyword option "HISTORY")
		File to which the history record will be written.

                                                                       
  image_filename	McIDAS image filename



PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

  NODT makes the appropriate calls into the CIMSS ODT library to
  calculate tropical cyclone intensity. The results are output to the
  screen as well as the history file.

REMARKS

  - Use of default history file will only provide user
    with CI value (which is actually the RAW T#).
    NO TIME AVERAGING OR OTHER ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE PERFORMED,
    and any output will only list this CI (raw T#) value.
  - If either LIST=YES or DELETE=YES
    ODT analysis will NOT be performed on current image.
  - If a record is modified/added within an existing history
    file, all subsequent records within the history file
    will be recalculated using the new/modified ODT record.
  - If DATE is provided in conjunction with LIST *AND*
    DELETE keywords, DATE will apply ONLY to the DELETE
    keyword (and a LIST will be drawn/listed for
    the entire history file (defaults)).


EXAMPLES

  nodt -c nmap2.cpf IR_19990915_1045

	- performs the ODT analysis on the image file IR_19990915_1045
          (located in the current working directoy) using the latitude and
          longitude in the cpf file "nmap2.cpf". The history file will be
	  the default history file "ODTDUMP.ODT".

  nodt -c 29.4,-78.8 -y $ODTHIST/floyd $SAT/GOES-E/TropAtl_8km/IR/IR_19990915_1045

	- performs the ODT analysis on the image file IR_19990915_1045 
	  (located in the directoy "$SAT/GOES-E/TropAtl_8km/IR") using a 
	  latitude of 29.4 and longitude of -78.8. The history file will 
	  be saved to the file "$ODTHIST/floyd".
