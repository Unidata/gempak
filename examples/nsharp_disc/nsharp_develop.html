<h1>New development progress</h1>
<h3>Animation of Pixmaps</h3>
<li>Added array of pixmaps and soundings with pointer to current sounding replacing
use of global variable SNDG thoughout computations. The sounding pointer is updated each
time the current pixmap is changed.
<li>Added Nxmlib animation controls
<li>Moved cursor value display out of animated pixmap (eg, the animated Pixmaps consist of
sounding and thermodynamic panels now without cursor values). Although this is not evident 
in the animated GIF below, the mouse postion readout is independently updated in
a single pixmap since this is not a static quantity for each sounding. Will clean up
the thermodynamic panel display positioning.

<li>Modified observed time selection widget for selection of sounding times
from aggregation of times in files matching the template. At this point, no
time line such as NMAP2 is implemented, rather all times in available files
are displayed in the scrolled widget. Multiple times can be selected as
EXTENDED_SELECTION events for a scrolled XmList using
the "CNTL+mouse1" method. Ranges of times can be selected by dragging,
or by selecting one time with "mouse1" and then another time with "mouse2"
(all times in the range will be selected). The locations displayed on the map
are those in the most recent time selected.
<li>BROWSE for selection of a single file only.
<li>Removed text widget for file name in observed selection.

<h3>Items remaining to be completed</h3>
<li>Update model selection and PFC selection for ranges. (3 days)
<li>Clean up unused callbacks. (1 day)

<h1>Items for consideration</h1>
<h3>Overlay button</h3>
<p>Current functionality allows the user to overlay a previously plotted
sounding with a new sounding from any source or time. The last sounding
data is copied from the SNDG array to SNDG2 array. The old sounding can not
be edited, and no information about the station/time/source is maintained
or displayed. The overlayed sounding is drawn in purple as shown below.
No time matching is attempted. Common uses would be to show how the atmosphere
at a location has modified between observed sounding times, to compare
model soundings at the same time from different initializations or models,
comparison between model forecast and observation, etc.</p>
<p>
How should overlay be handled with animation? 
<ul>
<li>Toggle overlay (eg only with single pixmap frame) vs separate pixmap for animation? 
<li>Maintain a single SNDG2 for display with any/all pixmaps?
<li>Keep MAXPIXMAPS number of SNDG2 arrays for separate overlay with each frame?
</ul>
</p>
<p> <img src="nsharp_overlay.gif"></p>

<li>Remove color bar at bottom of main panel?
<li>Should map selection in observed soundings be updated for all stations in selected range,
rather than just displaying those in the latest time of selection?
<li>Should Model time selection show all times available for all files matching template,
or should the user select model times and then forecast times separately?
<li>Should the thermodynamic parameter tables be forced to show the same "page"
when looping? Eg, if the use clicks "next page" button to look at storm relative
parameters for the current pixmap/sounding, should all pixmaps in the loop be
updated to that page, or would the user need/want to have independent control?
