     GRDNAM

     GRDNAM is the parameter name for the grid.  In GDDIAG, this is
     the output name of the grid to be created.   Time, level, and 
     vertical coordinate for the grid may be overridden by in-line
     parameters:

                ^time     @level    %ivcord

     appended to the output name of the grid in any combination.  If 
     the name is blank, the default name generated by the grid 
     diagnostics package will be used.
