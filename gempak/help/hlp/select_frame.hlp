                                 SELECT FRAME


The select frame panel is used to select a single frame within a metafile for 
display.  It may be invoked by clicking the "View" pull-down menu, and 
selecting "Select Frame," or by typing CTRL-V.

A frame may be displayed by either 1) double clicking on the desired frame 
within the scrollable list, or 2) single clicking on the desired frame and 
then clicking on the "Select" button.  Only one frame may be displayed at 
a time.
