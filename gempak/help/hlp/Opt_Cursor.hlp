The cursor size, type and color can be changed for the N-AWIPS GUI programs for 
the cursor that occurs in the data window.  The table $GEMTBL/config/cursorref.tbl 
specifies the default cursor attributes. Currently, attributes for three 
different types of cursors can be specified.

CURS_DEFAULT specifies the cursor for normal operations in the data area of the 
GUI programs. The default for this cursor is a small, red arrow.

CURS_BUSY specifies the cursor when the GUI program is performing an operation, 
such as loading data frames. The default for this cursor is a small, white cross.

CURS_POINT_SELECT specifies the cursor in NMAP/NMAP2 when using the seek or 
cloud height functions. The default for this cursor is a small, white 'X'.

NMAP/NMAP2 provide a GUI to alter the cursor attributes for each cursor type.  
Select the "Cursor" entry on the "Option" pulldown to invoke this GUI.

There are six different cursor types from which to chose: small arrow, large
arrow, small cross, large cross, small 'X' and large 'X'.  The color options
are: red, black, green, yellow, cyan, magenta and white.

See the documentation in cursorref.tbl for additional details.
