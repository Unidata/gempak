different than that of the source image.


INPUT PARAMETERS
 
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
 
   IMG2GD converts an image to a grid.

   GDFILE specifies the output grid file. If the file does not already
   exist, the file is created using the grid defined by CPYFIL,
   or if CPYFIL is not defined then by PROJ, GRDAREA, and KXKY.

   CPYFIL may provide either an existing grid file to read the projection
   information from, or a grid number (#nnn) defined in grdnav.tbl.

   PROJ, GRDAREA, and KXKY define a grid navigation as in GDCFIL if
   the output file does not already exist, and CPYFIL is blank.

   GRDNAM is the name of the output grid.

   GVCORD is the grid coordinate of the output grid.

   GDATTIM is the date/time of the output grid.

   IMGFIL is the source image file name or template to be copnverted
   to a grid.

   IMGTIM is the time to use for IMGFIL templates.

   CALIMG determines whether to use the supplied calibration information
   of the image for gridded values (YES), or use the raw pixel values of
   the image (NO).
