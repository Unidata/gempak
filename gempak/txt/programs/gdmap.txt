GDMAP plots data from a scalar grid.
 
INPUT PARAMETERS


PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
 
    GDMAP plots data computed from GEMPAK grid files on a map.
    Data may be plotted in any valid GEMPAK projection and
    may be overlaid on images.

    A list of times may be given in GDATTIM allowing animation
    of the data plots.
   
    The variable, POSN, is used to select the position for the 
    data relative to the grid point using the following position
    numbers: 

				7
			1		3
			2	0	4
			5		6
				8
  
    Position 0 will plot data centered at the station.  If an
    invalid position number is entered, position 0 will be used. 
  
    The variable, SCALE, is used to scale the data by 10 ** SCALE.
    The data will be scaled and then rounded to the nearest
    integer before it is plotted. 
 
    SKIP specifies the number of grid points to skip when displaying
    the data.  For example, SKIP = 1 displays data at every other
    grid point in each coordinate direction.  SKIP = 0 displays all
    points.

    If GRDLBL is not 0, the grid point row and column numbers will be
    displayed using the color number specified.  The grid rows and
    columns will be centered on the plot area.

    A map and title may also be included.   

EXAMPLES
 
    1.  Plot the dewpoint depression at 850 mb in color 3 at
	position 0.  The data will be plotted at every point
	for an area centered on Nebraska.  The row and column
	labels will be plotted in color 17.  The title will be
	written in color 1.

    2.  Do not clear the screen and replot the same function
	in color 7, for the same area.  The minimum value to
	plot is set to 10 in CINT.  The text of the title
	is changed to reflect the colored values.
