GDRADRC creates a gridded composite of Canadian (ASCII) products.

INPUT PARAMETERS
 
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

   GDRADRC samples ascii products to a common grid projection.

   GDFILE specifies the output grid file. If the file does not already
   exist, the file is created using the grid defined by CPYFIL,
   or if CPYFIL is not defined then by PROJ, GRDAREA, and KXKY.

   CPYFIL may provide either an existing grid file to read the projection
   information from, or a grid number (#nnn) defined in grdnav.tbl.

   PROJ, GRDAREA, and KXKY define a grid navigation as in GDCFIL if
   the output file does not already exist, and CPYFIL is blank.

   STNFIL is the station table which supplies radar IDs to be searched
   for the composite. If STNFIL is blank, then 'cradar.tbl' is used
   by default.

   GDPFUN is a list of data parameters for which composites are created.
   The NEXRAD file naming is assumed to be such that the site identifier
   and the product type are both present in the directory/file naming
   structure. The datatype.tbl template CRADAR is used to provide the
   file naming convention used. If CRADAR is not found in the template
   database, a default directory structure for ascii radar data is assumed
   where the root directory $RAD/cradar contains a tree structure supporting
   %SITE%/%PROD%/%PROD%_YYYYMMDD_HHNN file names. The %SITE% template
   will be replaced by the site IDs in the STNFIL table. The %PROD% will
   be replaced by the GDPFUN product name. The GEMPAK data/time template
   will be used with RADTIM and RADDUR to determine which NEXRAD products
   are in the valid time range.

   RADTIM determined the output grid time for the radar composite.
   The value of RADTIM may either be 'current', or a GEMPAK dattim.
   If 'current' is selected for RADTIM, then the current system clock
   time is used. No data files later than RADTIM will be included
   in the composite. RADDUR provides the time window previous to
   RADTIM in order to include data for each site. The time closest
   to RADTIM will be used. A default RADDUR of 30 minutes is
   used if RADDUR is blank.

   RADFRQ is the frequency in minutes at which the program will run. 
   When RADFRQ is defined, GDRADR will wait for the specified time
   before rerunning. This option is most useful when RADTIM is
   set to 'current'. When the program is sleeping, ctrl-c can be
   used to exit the loop and return to the dynamic tutor. If
   RADFRQ is not set, the dynamic tutor will be re-entered at the
   end of processing the radar mosaic.

 
EXAMPLES
 
    1.  Create a composite of CAPPI level1 reflectivity (N1R). Use the 
        current time with a 30 minute window for data. Rerun the mosaic 
        creation continuously with a 5 minute wait period between each 
        update. Use the cradar.tbl station table. Create the grid output 
        file using the YYYYMMDD_cradar.gem file name template. 

        PROJ     = lcc/50;-110;50
        GRDAREA  = 44;-128;47;-48
        KXKY     = 1700;950
        GDPFUN   = n1r
        GDFILE   = YYYYMMDD_cradar.gem
        RADTIM   = current
        RADDUR   = 30
        RADFRQ   = 5
        CPYFIL   =
        STNFIL   = cradar.tbl
        MAXGRD   = 1000
        NDVAL    = -9999
