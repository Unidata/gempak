GDTSER draws a time series of a scalar at a single level.
  
INPUT PARAMETERS 


PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    GDTSER draws a time series of a scalar parameter at a
    fixed level.  The variable may be any scalar computed by
    the grid diagnostics package.
  
    GPOINT specifies the location for the time series.  It may 
    be entered as a latitude and longitude separated with a
    semicolon, as a station character identifier or station
    number, or as a set of x and y grid points separated with a
    semicolon and preceded with an @.  The location may also 
    be selected graphically by setting GPOINT using the CURSOR
    command.  The location of the time series is then selected
    by clicking on a horizontal map in another GEMPAK XW window.
  
    The times to plot are specified in GDATTIM.  Only those
    times specified will be plotted.  Note that the times
    may represent a series of base times with the same or no
    forecast time, or a series with the same base time and
    a list of forecast times.
 
    The time axis is specified in TAXIS using the usual GEMPAK
    date/time conventions, including FIRST and LAST.  If 
    TAXIS has no increment, a reasonable value is chosen.
    If TAXIS is blank, the limits are taken from the first and 
    last valid times set in GDATTIM.
  
    If the user desires multiple lines on the same graph,
    TAXIS and YAXIS should be explicitly set; then LINE, MARKER,
    and TITLE can be varied for successive combinations of GLEVEL,
    GVCORD, GPOINT, and GFUNC.
 
    The axis type, height-to-width ratio of the plot and the
    margins may be specified in PTYPE.
   
EXAMPLES

    1.  Plot the BWI 500 mb temperature for the all of the forecast
        times in the file.  Label the Y axis from -15 to 15 in
        increments of 3 degrees.  Label the time axis from
        18/21 to 20/03 in increments of 12 h.  Make the plot
        half as high as wide.

	GPOINT	 =  bwi
	GDATTIM	 =  all
	GLEVEL	 =  500
	GVCORD	 =  pres
	GFUNC	 =  tmpc
	GDFILE	 =  $GEMPAK/data/hrcbob.grd
	PTYPE	 =  lin/.5
	TAXIS	 =  18/21-20/03
	YAXIS	 =  -15/15/3
	BORDER	 =  1
	LINE	 =  3//3
	MARKER	 =  2/13/1.25/2
	TITLE	 =  5//^  _  @  #
	CLEAR	 =  yes
	SCALE	 =  0
	PANEL	 =  0
	DEVICE	 =  xw
	TEXT	 =  1

    2.  Overlay the 700 mb temperature for all of the forecast
	times in the file.  Use the above specifications for 
	the other parameters.

	GPOINT	 =  bwi
	GDATTIM	 =  all
	GLEVEL	 =  700
	GVCORD	 =  pres
	GFUNC	 =  tmpc
	GDFILE	 =  $GEMPAK/data/hrcbob.grd
	PTYPE	 =  lin/.5
	TAXIS	 =  18/21-20/03
	YAXIS	 =  -15/15/3
	BORDER	 =  1
	LINE	 =  2//3
	MARKER	 =  3/13/1.25/2
	TITLE	 =  5/-2/^  _  @  #
	CLEAR	 =  no
	SCALE	 =  0
	PANEL	 =  0
	DEVICE	 =  xw
	TEXT	 =  1
