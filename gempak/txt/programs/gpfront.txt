GPFRONT is a version of GPMAP that plots map symbols interpreted
from the ASUS1 bulletins. Forecast front positions from FSUS2
bulletins can be plotted by specifying the forecast hour desired
from the bulletin (typically a bulletin contains 12 and 24 hour
forecast positions).

INPUT PARAMETERS
 
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    GPFRONT is derived from the standard GEMPAK program GPMAP.
    The behaviour is similar to gpmap, with the addition of
    plotting map symbols defined in an ASUS bulletin, with the
    map area specified. Satellite and radar data may be used 
    as backgrounds. ASFIL specifies the name or file template 
    of a front file. For ASUS1 bulletins which contain a single
    analysis time, ASHR is ignored. For FSUS2 bulletins that
    contain forecast positions for 12 and 24 hour progs,
    ASHR should be the desired forecast hour (eg 12 or 24).
    ASATT can be used to specify the scaling of H/L symbols drawn
    (default is 1.0), High and Low values flag (default is Y),
    and frontal pip size (default as same as weather symbols).

 
EXAMPLES
 
    1.  Draw a Lambert Conformal map of the US.
        Display frontal position from the file 98032016_frt.wmo. 

         GAREA    = uslcc
         PROJ     = lcc
         SATFIL   =
         RADFIL   =
         LATLON   = 0
         PANEL    = 0
         TITLE    = 2/-1/Frontal Positions 
         TEXT     = 3/31/2/hw
         CLEAR    = yes
         DEVICE   = xw
         ASFIL    = 98032016_frt.wmo
         ASHR     =
         ASATT    = 
         LUTFIL   = default
         IMCBAR   =
