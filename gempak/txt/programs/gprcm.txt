GPRCM is a version of GPMAP that plots Radar Coded Message (RCM)
bulletins.

INPUT PARAMETERS
 
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

   GPRCM is derived from the standard GEMPAK program GPMAP.
   The behavior is similar to gpmap, with the addition of
   reading Radar Coded Message (RCM) bulletins and optionally
   plotting radar echoes and/or annotations from the remarks
   included within the RCM bulletin. 

   RCM bulletins contain digitized reflectivity values derived 
   from the 2.2 x 2.2 nmi NIDS Composite reflectivity product
   over the radar area of coverage out to 248 nmi based on grid squares 
   approximately 5.4 nmi on a side. The reflectivity intensity
   value for each grid box is determined by assigning the maximum 
   value of all Composite Reflectivity boxes whose centers
   are contained within the grid square. The RCM message
   comprises 9 intesity categories as follows:
   
   Code                       Color Plotted
     0    ND
     1    15-30 dBZ             23
     2    30-40 dBZ             22
     3    40-45 dBZ             21
     4    45-50 dBZ             20
     5    50-55 dBZ             17
     6    >= 55 dBZ             15
     7    data beyond 124 nmi that are above threshold
     8    data beyond 124 nmi that are below threshold

   RCM data within a user specified time range are plotted.
 
   RCMFIL is the RCM data file. Bulletins with radar observation times
   in the RCM file will be plotted if the observation time is within
   the range specified by the starting and ending times.

   RADTIM (current or dattim) specifies the ending time for accepted data.
   RADDUR is the number of minutes prior to the ending time to begin
   accepting data.
   
   DITHER is used to specify the plotting behavior of the reflectivity
   intensities. A value of 0 specifies no dithering, the grid box is
   completely filled. Values 1-4 increase the number of dither points
   per grid box, approaching an increasingly opaque value. Dither
   can be used to overlay image data with radar reflectivity in
   order to simulate transparency. A dither value >= 5 will outline
   the grid box.

   MESO specifies the color/marker/size/width/hw for mesocyclones to be 
   marked. A color value of 0 is used to turn off mesocyclone plotting.
   Marker attributes behave as MARKER for other plotting programs.

   TVS specifies the color/marker/size/width/hw for tornado vortex signatures 
   to be marked. A color value of 0 is used to turn off TVS plotting.

   CNTR specifies the color/size/width for Cell Centroid movement barbs (knots).
   A value of 0 is used to turn off centroid plotting.

   MAXTOP specifies the color for cell top annotations (feet).
   A value of 0 is used to turn off cell top annotations.

   RADINFO specifies the color for radar site operational status annotations.
   NA, data not available; OM, out for maintenance; NE, no echoes.

   ECHO specifies whether to plot the grid box intesities. A value of 0
   specifies no plotting of echoes; 1 specifies plotting only those 
   echoes from radars in precipitation mode; 2 specifies plotting
   of echoes from radars in both precipitation and clear air mode.

   RCM summary information is directed to OUTPUT. Summary information
   includes the station ID, reorting time, operational mode, and
   mesocyclone and tornado vortex signature locations (if present).

   GPRCM utilizes the nexrad.tbl station table to determine the radar
   location (not all RCM bulletins contain radar location as of Nov. 1999).
   The radars listed in the station table are also used to determine
   which locations are missing (Not Available: NA).

 
EXAMPLES
 
    1.  Draw a Lambert Conformal map of the US.
        Display RCM data from the file rcm.dat. Plot radar observations
        for the past 60 minutes. Display the echo intensities (no dithering), 
        maxtop values in yellow, and radar status in red. Do not plot mesocyclone, 
        or TVS locations. Plot the cell centroid motion barbs in white.
        Use echoes from radar sites operating in precipitation mode only. Use
        the default CLRBAR positioning.

         GAREA    = us
         PROJ     = str/90;-105;0
         SATFIL   =
         RADFIL   =
         LATLON   = 0
         PANEL    = 0
         TITLE    = 1/-1/Radar Summary 
         TEXT     = 1.3/22/1/hw
         CLEAR    = yes

         LUTFIL   =
         IMBAR    = 
	 OUTPUT   = T

    2.  Overlay the IR satellite imagery with RCM data for the US west coast. 
        Use a DITHER value of 2 to for moderate transparency. Plot the radar
        CLRBAR horizontally above title. Satellite CLRBAR will be vertical along 
        the left side of the image (default location from IMBAR).

         GAREA    = ca-

         LUTFIL   = default
         IMBAR    = 1
	 OUTPUT   = T

    3.  Display the current RCM data using the RCMDAT file template and allow
        searching back 90 minutes. Do not filter TVS plotting, use a filter
        of .3 for MESO plotting, a filter of .5 for CNTR, and 1.0 (aka YES)
        for MAXTOP plotting. Send summary output to the terminal as well as
        to a file named rcm.summary.
