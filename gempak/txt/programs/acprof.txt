ACPROF draws profiles of ACARS data 

INPUT PARAMETERS
 

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
 
    ACPROF draws profiles of ACARS data. The program is derived from
    SNPROF to use ACARS data stored in ship format files. If AREA
    is given as a single tail number (eg @FSL0001) then only data from
    that aircraft will be used. If AREA is given as a region (eg DEN)
    then all aircraft in vicinity of that location will be used.
    AREA can be expanded/contracted as usual with +,*/-. All observations
    in the given time range will be used. Once data is obtained, program 
    behavior is similar to SNPROF.

    Any two parameters that can be computed from the data set can
    be plotted.  These parameters are specified in SNPARM.
    The profiles' colors, line types, and widths are
    specified in LINE.  Markers identifying the data points
    can be plotted by setting a color in MARKER. A different MARKER
    number is assigned to each aircraft. If marker numbers overlap, the 
    marker color is incremented.

    The type of y axis is specified in PTYPE.  LIN, LOG, STUVE,
    and SKEW are all valid.  Note that SKEW is only valid when
    plotting temperature vs. pressure.  The bottom and top of
    the axis, along with an increment for labels, are set in
    YAXIS.  If the panel is changed to be less than the full
    screen, the default margins will often be too large.  The
    margins can be set explicitly in PTYPE.

    Winds are plotted in the right margin and can be specified in
    WIND.  There are three positions available for plotting winds.
    They are numbered 1 to 3, with 1 being the leftmost position.
    The location for the wind to be plotted is specified in WINPOS.
    The positions also apply to the station identifier, date/time
    and stability indices which are plotted above the diagram.

    Dry adiabats, moist adiabats and mixing ratio background
    lines can be added to the diagram.  The attributes of these
    lines are specified in THTALN, THTELN, and MIXRLN.

    If the color is set to 0, no lines will be plotted.  If the
    start, stop and increment are not set, defaults will be
    supplied.  Note that these lines can only be drawn on plots
    of pressure versus temperature.

    FILTER in this program determines whether the wind barbs are
    filtered.
