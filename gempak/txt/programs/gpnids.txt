INPUT PARAMETERS


PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    GPNIDS plots NEXRAD Level III products. 

    RADFIL is the NEXRAD Level III input file. A template may 
    be specified, with an optional site name and product type 
    (eg NEXRIII|DDC|NWV). If a site name is provided, it will 
    be used to replace the %SITE% alias in the template name.
    If a product type is provided, it will be used to replace
    the %PROD% alias in the template string if present. Products
    will br plotted in graph or map coordinates depending on
    the type of product. For VAD wind profile products (NVW) the 
    display is graph coordinates, while raster and radial images, 
    and overlay products (eg mesocyclone, storm track, tvs etc) are
    displayed in map coordinates. The NEXRIII template is provided 
    for NEXRAD Level III files.

    RADTIM is a valid GEMPAK date/time string or abbreviation. 
    A time range may be specified.

    CLRBAR specifies the attributes used to plot the RMS ranges
    of the VAD winds.

    IMCBAR displays the coresponding image calibration bar for
    raster and radial products.

    WIND can be used to select the type and plot size of barbs or
    arrows for the vectors in the VAD display.

    TEXT can be used to control the attributes used to plot the text
    symbols contained in the NIDS product file.

    COLORS provides the color used for the TEXT symbols.
    Colors for the axes and wind vectors for VAD products (NVW) are 
    specified in the gpvad.config file. If the file does not exist, 
    a default set of colors will be used. The config file will be searched 
    for in the standard locations, including the current working directory
    in order to allow the user to tailor colors for the individual
    application. $GEMTBL/unidata/gpvad.config is provided.

    LINE is used to control the attributes of lines displayed
    in the products.

    OUTPUT is used to direct display of the tablular and alphanumeric 
    portions of the NIDS products.

EXAMPLES

    1.	Plot the VAD profile for radar location FFC using the NEXRIII 
	template for the most recent time. Use wind barbs, and plot the
	RMS bar along the altitude axis.
        
	RADFIL   = NEXRIII|FFC|NVW
	RADTIM   = last
	WIND     = bk1
	TITLE    = 1/-2/VAD DISPLAY ~
	PANEL    = 0
	DEVICE   = XW
	CLEAR    = y
	TEXT     = 1/1/1/hw
	CLRBAR   = 1/v/cl/.05;.5/.3;.01
        MAP      = 0

 
    2.	Plot an animated VAD profile series for radar location FFC
	using the NEXRIII template and specifying the time range
	from 21Z to 23Z today.

	RADFIL   = NEXRIII|FFC|NVW
	RADTIM   = 2200-2300
	WIND     = bk1
	TITLE    = 1/-2/VAD DISPLAY ~
	PANEL    = 0
	DEVICE   = XW
	CLEAR    = y
	TEXT     = 1/1/1/hw
	CLRBAR   = 1/v/cl/.05;.5/.3;.01
        MAP      = 0

    3.  Plot the Composite Reflectivity product for SJT and display the
        text storm attribute table to the terminal.

        RADFIL   = NEXRIII|SJT|NCR
        RADTIM   = last
        WIND     = 
        TITLE    = 1/-2
        PANEL    = 0
        DEVICE   = xw
        CLEAR    = Y
        TEXT     = 1/2/2/hw
        CLRBAR   = 
        IMCBAR   = 5/v/LL/.005;.6/.4;.01
        OUTPUT   = t
        GAREA    = dset
        COLORS   = 7
        MAP      = 6
        LATLON   = 0
        LINE     = 

    4.  Overlay the Storm Tracking Information product for SJT on the
        composite reflectivity display in #3.

        RADFIL   = NEXRIII|SJT|STI
        RADTIM   = last
        TITLE    = 1/-2
        PANEL    = 0
        DEVICE   = xw
        CLEAR    = n
        TEXT     = 1/2/2/hw
        COLORS   = 7
        LINE     = 31/1/4
        WIND     = 
        CLRBAR   = 
        IMCBAR   = 5/v/LL/.005;.6/.4;.01
        GAREA    = dset
        MAP      = 6
        LATLON   = 0
        OUTPUT   = t
