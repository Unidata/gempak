NEXR2RHI displays NEXRAD level II vertical cross sections.

INPUT PARAMETERS
 
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

   NEXR2RHI displays NEXRAD Level II vertical cross sections for
   data in ARCHIVE2 format. This program is adopted from GDCROSS to 
   create a volume rendering of NEXRAD data along a specified 
   axis.

   RADFIL specifies the input Level II file. A template may be
   specified, with an optional site name (eg NEXRII|KDDC).
   If a site name is provided, it will be used to replace the %SITE%
   alias in the template name. The NEXRII template is provided
   for ARCHIVE2 format files.

   RADPARM is the Radar parameter to be displayed. Valid values are
   dz (reflectivity), vr (radial velocity), sw (spectrum width). 

   RADTIM is a valid GEMPAK date/time string or abbreviation. A time 
   range may be specified.

   INTERP is a logical variable which determines whether interpolation
   between sweeps will occur.

   CXSTNS is the cross section axis (as in GDCROSS). A grid coordinate
   can be used with row and colums 1 to 920.

   GVCORD is the vertical coordinate of the radar data (always HGHT).

   PTYPE is the plot type. A value of "LIN" is generally the only
   useful setting.

   Other parameters as in GDCROSS.

EXAMPLES
 
    1. Display an East-West RHI which passes through the radar location
    for reflectivity data from KLVX. Display the RHI from 0 to 20KM
    using color filled contours. Use a contour interval of 4 dBZ
    with a minimum value of -12 dBZ. Grid point 460;460 is the radar center.
    Interpolate contours between beam scans.

    CXSTNS   = @1;460>@920;460
    GVCORD   = hght
    PTYPE    = lin
    YAXIS    = 0/20000
    CINT     = 0
    SCALE    = 0
    LINE     = 1
    BORDER   = 1
    SKIP     = 0
    TITLE    = 1/-2/RHI Base Reflectivity Level II ^
    CLEAR    = YES
    DEVICE   = xw
    TEXT     = .8/1/1/111/hw
    PANEL    = 0
    CLRBAR   = 1
    CONTUR   = 3/2
    FINT     = 4
    FLINE    = 0;30-7
    CTYPE    = f
    RADFIL   = NEXRII|KLVX
    RADPARM  = dz
    RADTIM   = last
    INTERP   = y 

    2. Display a cross section of radial velocity from 38.6N;86.8W to
    37.4N;84.8W. Plot filled contours at 4 m/s intervals. Display data
    from 0 to 20km. Allow interpolation between beam scans. Use 
    line countours, with negative values contoured by a dotted line,
    positive values contoured with a solid line.

    CXSTNS   = 38.6;-86.8>37.4;-84.8
    GVCORD   = hght
    PTYPE    = lin
    YAXIS    = 0/20000
    CINT     = 4
    SCALE    = 0
    LINE     = 5/-10
    BORDER   = 1
    SKIP     = 0 
    TITLE    = 1/-2/RHI Radial Velocity Level II ^
    CLEAR    = YES
    DEVICE   = xw
    TEXT     = .8/1/1/111/hw
    PANEL    = 0
    CLRBAR   = 
    CONTUR   = 3/2
    FINT     = 
    FLINE    = 
    CTYPE    = c
    RADFIL   = NEXRII|KLVX
    RADPARM  = vr
    RADTIM   = last
    INTERP   = y
