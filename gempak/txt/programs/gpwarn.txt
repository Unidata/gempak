GPWARN is a version of GPMAP that plots filled county/zone regions from reports
which use the univeral generic county/zone identifier lines.

INPUT PARAMETERS
 
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    GPWARN is derived from the standard GEMPAK program GPMAP.
    The behaviour is similar to gpmap, with the addition of
    plotting filled county/zones defined in a UGC specifier
    with the map area specified. Satellite and radar data may 
    be used as backgrounds. 

   NWSTG Products which use the UGC identifier line include:

                                   PIL
   Tornado Warnings                TOR
   Severe Thunderstorm Warnings    SVR
   Flood Watches                   FLA|FFA
   Flood Warnings                  FLW|FFW
   Winter Weather Bulletins        WSW
   Non-precipitation Bulletins     NPW
   Special Weather Statements      SPS

   GPWARN finds the UGC line following the pil line in the
   bulletin which looks like:
   ALC129-131-MSC041-046>052-281030-

   The program determines the counties/zone which are included in the
   bulletin, along with the expiration time. The map information
   for the county or zone to be plotted is read from the $GEMTBL/bounds
   files. Each county is filled and outlined with a color code based 
   on bulletin type and expiration time.

   The following gempak color codes are used:

   Type            Current         Expired
                   fill/outline    fill/outline
   Tornado         2/5             13/10
   Tstorm          14/5            13/10
   Flood Watch     21/5            19/18
   Flood Warn      23/5            19/18
   Winter          4/5             26/10
   Non-precip      7/5             29/10
   Special         6/5             24/26

   The bulletins are read from the text bulletins which are 
   also used with NWX. These bulletins are stored under the
   $TEXT_DATA tree under watch_warn/torn_warn, watch_warn/tstrm_warn,
   watch_warn/winter, watch_warn/noprcp, watch_warn/special,
   fflood/watch, fflood/warn.

   The program allows the user to specify an input file list using the
   WWFIL parameter. Multiple file names or template aliases may be
   entered by separating each entry with a semicolor (;). File templates 
   should be defined in $GEMTBL/config/datatype.tbl.

   GPWARN will search for the files by checking for a template, and
   then using the file name given, as well as 
   relative to $TEXT_DATA, eg.:
  
   WWFIL = tstrmwarn 
   WWFIL = $TEXT_DATA/watch_warn/tstrm_warn/1997012800.warn
   WWFIL = watch_warn/tstrm_warn/1997012800.warn
   WWFIL = /fullpath/nwx/watch_warn/tstrm_warn/1997012800.warn

   each of the above entries are valid.

   The time for the plot may be spacified as current or a valid GEMPAK
   format YYMMDD/HHMM time using the parameter WWS, eg:

   WWS = cur
   WWS = 970128/0000

   GPWARN will use the time in WWS to determine if a bulletin
   has expired by comparing against the time on the UGC line.

   The time range for plotted bulletins is set using the WWATT
   parameter. This parameter allows the user to specify how
   long after the bulletin has expired that it will still be
   plotted, and how far in the future bulletins will be viewed.
   The format is WWATT = min_prior/min_future,
   where min_prior and min_future are integers in minutes.
   No display will occure for bulletins which have expired
   greater than min_prior minutes before the time in WWS.

   For bulletins which have not yet expired, min_future will
   determine if the bulletin is to be plotted. This feature
   is useful when plotting historical data, where products
   exist at later times than were available at the time which
   the plot represents, or in the case of advisories such
   as winter storm bulletins which may be issued well in
   advance of the expected conditions.

   If min_future is negative (eg -60), then no display will
   occur for bulletins which expire greater than 60 minutes
   in the future. If min_future is positive (eg 60), then
   bulletins that expire greater than 60 minutes in the
   future will be displayed in white, so that they are not
   confused with those regions which are more immenent.

   For product generation scripts, you may which to cat
   each of the desired file types to be plotted into a
   single input file, otherwise, you may run the program
   a sperate time for each input file desired.

   The default it WWATT is blank is 1440/1440. If only
   one value is specified, it is used for both.

   In addition to plotting warnings, GPWARN also provides the
   option of plotting counties included within watched using
   the SVRL parameter as used in GPMAP. The files for SVRL are
   generated by the dcsvrl decoder.

   Color and line types for the areas drawn by GPWARN are specified 
   in the gpwarn.config file. If the file does not exist, a default
   set of colors will be used. The config file will be searched for
   in the standard locations, including the current working directory
   in order to allow the user to tailor colors for the individual
   application.


 
EXAMPLES
 
    1.  Draw a Lambert Conformal map of the US.
        Display current tornado, severe thunderstorm, flood,
        winter weather and non-precipitation warnings. 
        Show counties/zones for up to 120 minutes after tha
        warning has expired. Begin to show warnings 1440
        minutes before they take affect. 

         GAREA    = uslcc
         PROJ     = lcc
         SATFIL   =
         RADFIL   =
         LATLON   = 0
         PANEL    = 0
         TITLE    = 2/-2/Current Warnings 
         TEXT     = 1.3/22/1/hw
         CLEAR    = yes
         DEVICE   = xw
         SVRL     = 
         WWFIL    = nonpcpwarn;winterwarn;floodwarn;tstormwarn;tornadowarn
         WWS      = current
         WWATT    = 120/1400
