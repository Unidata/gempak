GPMAP draws a map, latitude/longitude lines, and various image and
graphic products.


INPUT PARAMETERS


PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    GPMAP draws a map and/or latitude/longitude lines for a specified 
    graphics area.  Plots may be drawn in any GEMPAK projection and 
    may be overlaid on images.  GPMAP also post-processes NMAP 
    Vector Graphics Files (VGFs) to create products in any format 
    supported by GEMPAK device drivers.  In addition, GPMAP displays 
    various types of graphics products including AWIPS, AFOS, watches, 
    warnings, tropical or hurricane storm tracks, international
    SIGMETs, lightning, ATCF tracks, airmets, non-convective 
    sigmets, severe local storm watches, winter storm warning,
    watch and advisory, convective sigmets, and ensemble cyclone tracks.

    Images are animated if more than one image file is specified in 
    SATFIL or RADFIL.  Images are sampled to correspond to the 
    geographic area specified by GAREA.  The geographic area may be 
    defined graphically by setting GAREA using the CURSOR command.  
    This command allows for interactive zooming of images and the 
    corresponding map and latitude/longitude plots. 

    GPMAP can post-process NMAP VGFs to create products in different
    formats including AFOS, AWIPS Redbook, GIF, TIFF, 6 bit FAX, and
    PostScript.  The VGFILE variable specifies the input VGF and the 
    DEVICE variable specifies the desired output format.  VGF object 
    attributes may be modified when creating products by specifying 
    a table (attribute file) in the VGFILE variable.  This table uses 
    the same format as the $GEMTBL/pgen/setting.tbl to alter object 
    attributes.  For example, the color, width, and smoothing flag 
    attributes can be changed for a solid line by setting them in the 
    attribute file.  The table, $GEMTBL/pgen/uattribd.tbl, provides a
    template for this capability.  Refer to this table for additional 
    details.  GPMAP can also scale attributes for an entire class of
    objects by specifying a table (scale file) in the VGFILE 
    variable.  Refer to the scale.fax table in $GEMTBL/pgen for 
    additional information.

    GPMAP can also plot the current thunderstorm and tornado watches.
    The parameter WATCH sets the ending time and the colors for
    plotting the watches.  The parameter WARN sets the ending time
    and the colors for plotting warnings.  The parameter WSTM sets the
    ending time and the colors for plotting winter storm warning, watch,
    and advisory. The parameter FFA sets the ending time and the colors
    for plotting flash flood and areal flood watches. The parameter CSIG
    sets the ending time and the colors for plotting convective sigmets.
    The parameter HRCN sets the ending time and the colors for plotting
    tropical depressions, storms, and hurricane positions.  Optionally,
    a specific storm name may be entered to display only that specific
    tropical disturbance. The parameter ISIG sets the ending time and
    the colors for plotting international SIGMETs.  The parameter LTNG
    sets the ending time, time increments, colors and markers for
    plotting lightning data. The parameter ATCF sets the time, models
    and colors for plotting ATCF (Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecast)
    tracks.  As with HRCN, a specific storm name may be entered.  The
    parameter AIRM sets the ending time and the colors for plotting
    airmets.  The parameter NCON sets the ending time and the colors for
    plotting non-convective sigmets.  The parameter SVRL sets the ending
    time and the colors for plotting severe local storms watches. The
    parameter WOU sets the ending time and the colors for plotting the
    watch outline update (WOU). The parameter WCN sets the ending time
    and the colors for plotting the watch county notification(WCN).  The
    parameter WCP sets the ending time and the colors for plotting the
    watch corner product.  The parameter ENCY sets the initial time,
    colors, model names, and date/time, pressure and marker flags for
    plotting of the ensemble cyclone tracks.

    GPMAP can also plot QuikScat and ASCAT ocean vector wind data.
    The parameter QSCT sets the type of QuikScat data (QSCT, QSCT_HI,
    and four possible ambiguities, AMBG1, AMBG2, AMBG3, and AMBG4).
    This parameter also sets the ending time, windspeed increments,
    colors for plotting, wind barb/arrow attributes, timestamp
    attributes and various plotting-related flags. The parameter ASCT 
    does the same for the ASCAT winds (ASCT, ASCT_HI, and the four
    ambiguities, AAMBG1, AAMBG2, AAMBG1_HI, AAMBG2_HI).
