SFL604 lists data from a GEMPAK surface file in a fixed format.
 
INPUT PARAMETERS


PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
    
    SFL604 lists data from a surface file in a format designed to
    display airways data.  
 
    Data will be listed for the stations and times requested in
    AREA and DATTIM.  If SKPMIS is YES, stations that are within
    the area requested, but have not reported data, will not
    be listed.  If SKPMIS is set to NO, then only the date and 
    station identifier will be listed for nonreporting stations.
  
    Stations may be identified in the output listing by character
    or numeric identifier.  This is accomplished by setting IDNTYP
    to STID or STNM.
    
    This program will list predefined parameters only.  However,
    stations may be selected using conditions in SFPARM.  For
    example, if SFPARM = WTHR=S+, then only those stations 
    reporting heavy snow will be listed.  The conditions specified
    in SFPARM can be for any computable parameter, not just
    those to be listed.

EXAMPLES

    1.	List the data for all stations in Pennsylvania at
	the most recent time.

	SFFILE	 =  $GEMPAK/data/hrcbob.sfc
	AREA	 =  @pa
	DATTIM	 =  last 
	OUTPUT	 =  t
	SKPMIS	 =  yes
	IDNTYP	 =  stid 
	SFPARM	 =  

    2.	List the data for all times at PHL. 

	SFFILE	 =  $GEMPAK/data/hrcbob.sfc
	AREA	 =  @phl
	DATTIM	 =  all
	OUTPUT	 =  t
	SKPMIS	 =  yes
	IDNTYP	 =  stid 
	SFPARM	 =  

    3.	List all stations in Pennsylvania, including nonreporting
	stations for the last time. 

	SFFILE	 =  $GEMPAK/data/hrcbob.sfc
	AREA	 =  @pa
	DATTIM	 =  last
	OUTPUT	 =  t
	SKPMIS	 =  no
	IDNTYP	 =  STID
	SFPARM	 =  

    4.	List all stations in Pennsylvania where there are reported
	thunderstorms.

	SFFILE	 =  $GEMPAK/data/hrcbob.sfc
	AREA	 =  @pa
	DATTIM	 =  LAST
	OUTPUT	 =  t
	SKPMIS	 =  yes
	IDNTYP	 =  STID
	SFPARM	 =  wthr=t
