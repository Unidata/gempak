GDOBSCNT creates a gridded sampling of the number of surface observations
within a specified radius of each grid point.

INPUT PARAMETERS

 
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

   GDOBSCNT produces a grid for each time found in a surface file.

   SFFILE specifies the input surface file. Each station in the
   surface file will be checked to see if it is within the 
   specified radius of every grid point in the output grid file.

   GDFILE specifies the output grid file. It must already exist.

   RADIUS is the distance in meters for which a surface station
   will contribute to the observed density at a grid point.

EXAMPLES
 
    1.  Create a grid for each time within the NLDN lightning file
        showing the number of strikes within 50km of each grid point.
        The grid file (obs.grd) has already been created with GDCFIL.

        SFFILE   = nldn 
	DATTIM   = all
        GDFILE   = obs.grd
        RADIUS   = 50000
