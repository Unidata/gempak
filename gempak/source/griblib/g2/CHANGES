g2lib-1.0   - August 2003 - Original version

g2libc-1.0.1 - May 2004 - Changed the library name from "libg2c.a" to 
                          "libgrib2c.a" to avoid conflict with the g77 libg2c
                          library.
                        - Added support for Grid Definition Template 3.31,
                          Albers Equal Area.
                        - Changed most PDT templates in module pdstemplates to
                          allow negative surface values.
                        - Many minor changes to help get clean compiles.

g2libc-1.0.2 - December 2004 - WMO approved the JPEG2000 and PNG Data
                             Representation Templates ( 5.40000 and 5.40010,
                             respectively ) for operational use.  The templates
                             were assigned WMO values of 5.40 and 5.41,
                             respectively.  Changes were made to the source to
                             recognize either template number.
                           - Fixed bug encountered when packing a near constant
                             field with DRT 5.40 or 5.40000 (JPEG2000).
                           - Added consistency check, provided by 
                             Arthur Taylor/MDL, used when unpacking Data 
                             Templates 7.2 and 7.3.
                           - Added functionality to support encoding of
                             "Missing" data values within the data field when
                             using Data Representation Templates 5.2
                             (complex packing) and 5.3 (complex packing and
                             spatial differencing).  See octets 23 - 31 in DRTs
                             5.2 and 5.3 for more info on missing value
                             management.
                           - Increased the packing efficiency of Data
                             Representation Templates 5.2 and 5.3 by adding
                             MDL/Glahn algorithm for determining effective
                             groupings.
