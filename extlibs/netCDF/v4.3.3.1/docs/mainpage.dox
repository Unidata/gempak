\section what_is_netcdf What is NetCDF?

NetCDF is a set of software libraries and self-describing, machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.  NetCDF was developed and is maintained at <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu">Unidata</a>. Unidata provides data and software tools for use in geoscience education and research. Unidata is part of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (<a href="http://www.ucar.edu">UCAR</a>) Community Programs (<a href="http://www.uop.ucar.edu">UCP</a>). Unidata is funded primarily by the National Science Foundation.

The NetCDF homepage may be found at <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf</a>.  The NetCDF source-code is hosted at <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>, and may be found directly at <a href="http://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c">http://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c</a>.
