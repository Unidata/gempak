GEMPAK, the GEneral Meteorology PAcKage, is an analysis, display, and product generation package for meteorological data.   Originally developed by NCEP for
use by the National Centers (SPC, TPC, AWC, HPC, OPC, SWPC, etc.) in producing operational forecast and analysis products.  UCAR's Unidata Program Center releases and support a non-operational version of GEMPAK for use in research and education.

64-bit Red Hat-flavored Linux (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora) is recommened for source builds, but GEMPAK can be built from source on nearly any Unix-based system. Specific instructions for <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/gempak/doc/install_osx.html">building on OS X</a> are available as well.

GEMPAK can be installed by an individual user, and root / superuser permission is not required. For this guide and throughout other online documentation it is assumed that GEMPAK is installed for a **gempak** user account in the home directory `/home/gempak/GEMPAK7`.

**It is important that you read this entire document if you are building from source**.

## RPM and Source Code Tarball

See the <a href="https://github.com/Unidata/gempak/releases">GEMPAK Releases on GitHub</a> for the latest version.  GEMPAK source code is also available from the <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/gempak/">Unidata download page</a>.

To install the latest RPM to a custom directory use the `--prefix` argument, where `--prefix=/home/user` will install to `/home/user/GEMPAK7/`

        sudo rpm -ivh --prefix=/home/user gempak-XXX-1.x86_64.rpm

## Quick Source Code build (*bash*)

Install all prerequisites:

        sudo yum install openmotif-devel gcc gcc-c++ gcc-gfortran libX11-devel libXt-devel \
        libXext-devel libXp-devel libXft-devel libXtst-devel xorg-x11-xbitmaps flex byacc *fonts-ISO8859-* python-devel -y

Now build all libraries and programs:

        cd GEMPAK7
        . Gemenviron.profile
        make everything

## Quick Source Code build against Python

        cd GEMPAK7
        . Gemenviron.profile
        . source_python.sh
        make everything

## Create the NAWIPS symbolic link

After installing or building from source, but before running any GEMAPK programs, you should create a symbolic link NAWIPS in your home directory to maintain a single command in **.cshrc** or **.profile** that sources the current GEMPAK installation:

        ln -s GEMPAK7/ NAWIPS
        
Your **gempak** home directory should then contain the following:

        /home/gempak/GEMPAK7
        /home/gempak/NAWIPS -> GEMPAK7

If you unpacked and plan to install GEMPAK in an uncommon directory (such as **/opt/gempak/**), you'll need to edit the NAWIPS definition at the top of the appropriate Gemenviron file.

## Gemenviron / Gemenviron.profile

To build GEMPAK on your system, the environmental variable **$NAWIPS** must be defined at the top of **Gemenviron** [ for csh/tcsh ] or **Gemenviron.profile** [ for bash/ksh ]. These files contain definitions for the locations of various components used by GEMPAK. It is the responsibility of the GEMPAK administrator to confirm that **$NAWIPS** is defined correctly with the full path of the `GEMPAK7` directory. Other variables which point to the location of data directories, tables and can be tailored at your lesiure, but it's recommended that only **$NAWIPS** be modified as all other variables related to GEMPAK are dependant on **$NAWIPS**.

If you unpacked GEMPAK in **/home/gempak** and plan on compiling with gfortran, you can skip this step.

        setenv NAWIPS /home/gempak/GEMPAK7

### csh/tcsh

source the full path of Gemenviron in your .cshrc

        source /home/gempak/NAWIPS/Gemenviron

### bash

add the following to .profile

        . /home/gempak/NAWIPS/Gemenviron.profile

Important environmental variable to be familiar with are:

        $NAWIPS as defined above
        $GEMPAK points to $NAWIPS/gempak
        $GEMTBL points to $GEMPAK/tables
        $OS_BIN points to $GEMPAK/os/$NA_OS/bin
        $OS_LIB points to $GEMPAK/os/$NA_OS/lib
        $GEMMAPS points to $GEMPAK/maps
        $GEMDATA points to /data/ldm/gempak
        $NA_OS is determined by Gemenviron (linux, linux64, x86, SunOS, Darwin, etc. )

The last definition, **$GEMDATA**, points to the **/data/ldm/gempak** but can be changed depending on how you <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/gempak/doc/configuration.html">install and configure the LDM</a>.

## Required Libraries

If your system uses standard locations for its compilers, X11/Motif libraries and make utilities, you do not needto change any settings. It's assumed both an ansi compatible C compiler and a Fortran 77 compatible compiler are available. Some operating systems provide the MOTIF libraries, but some only install them as an option. 

The Open Motif 2.3.4 source tarball can be downloaded from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/motif/files/">motif sourceforge page</a>. Binary packages are also available for <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/motif/files/">Red Hat, Fedora and Ubuntu</a> operating systems.

The package <b>python-devel</b> is required to build GEMPAK against system Python or <a href="http://python-awips.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about.html#awips-ii-python-stack">AWIPS Python</a>. The Python package <b>python-awips</b> is not required to build GEMPAK, but is required at run-time when requesting EDEX grids such as <b>A2NAM</b> and <b>A2GFS</b>.

## Install all prerequisites

        sudo yum install openmotif-devel gcc gcc-c++ gcc-gfortran libX11-devel libXt-devel \
        libXext-devel libXp-devel libXft-devel libXtst-devel xorg-x11-xbitmaps flex byacc *fonts-ISO8859-* python-devel -y

## Build Options

### Gemenviron / Gemenviron.profile

To change the GCC compiler, edit the **USE_GFORTRAN**, **USE_PGI** and **USE_G77** definitions in **Gemenviron** or **Gemenviron.profile** (**gfortran** is the default):

        set USE_GFORTRAN=1

## Makeinc.common

For most systems, GEMPAK will be built using either g77 or gfortran[4.1+]. Files located in **$NAWIPS/config/** contain information specific to the individual platform you will be installing on (sol, x86, hpux, linux, osf, irix, aix, freebsd, darwin).

### SunOS-Specific Options

Bundled cc is not ansi compatible, so SunOS users should make sure SUNWspro/bin/cc is found before **/usr/ucb/cc** in your path. Also, you will need to ensure that /usr/ccs/bin is in your path.

### Ubuntu Linux

Ubuntu builds require the compiler flag `-fno-stack-protector` be added to **COPT** (C compiler options) and FOPT (fortran compiler options). Ubuntu-specific Makeinc files are provided in **$NAWIPS/config/** that include this compiler flag:

        $NAWIPS/config/Makeinc.linux_gfortran_ubuntu
        $NAWIPS/config/Makeinc.linux64_gfortran_ubuntu

### Mac OS X

<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/gempak/doc/install_osx.html">Mac OS X GEMPAK Installation Guide</a> by Kevin Tyle, University of Albany.

This document will guide users through building GEMPAK on Intel Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) with GCC 4.4 compilers. The same procedure should also work for 10.5 (Leopard), but earlier versions/CPU's of OS X remain untested.

## Compiling GEMPAK Source

### Make

GEMPAK and various bundled libearies are compiled from source by the Make tool, using the Fortran and C compilers specified in the above configuration files. From $NAWIPS issue the command

        make all >& make.out

The redirection command `>&` sends **STDOUT** to the log file make.out. The Make process takes several minutes to complete, first compiling libraries such as netCDF, ncepBUFR, HDF5 and zlib, followed by the GEMPAK source. In another terminal you can follow the STDOUT log with the command

        tail -f make.out

or attach an ampersand to send make to the background and tail the log instantly

        make all >& make.out & tail -f make.out

This process allows you to examine the build as it runs but preserves the output in the event something goes horribly wrong. If seeking help from Unidata, attach some or all of this make.out log. One should note that with the Makefile installation, only fatal errors (errors that cause the build to end prematurely) are significant, and most "warnings" can be ignored.

## Install & Clean

        make install; make clean

Executables are installed to **$OS_BIN** and libraries should already be located in **$OS_LIB**.

The command make clean will remove compiled objects and binary executables from the source tree.

If your distribution is modified by patches or other edits and updates and you have to rebuild, the compilation time will be reduced as the libraries which took the majority of the time to build already exist.

## Cleaning a Build

In the event that core definitions change and libraries must be built from scratch, a the entire install for your system will need to be cleaned:

        make distclean

This full clean will delete all objects and executables as well as all libraries built for the current system.

### Everything

        make everything

This command will combine the steps of make all, make install and make clean to build and install the package, but will not log **STDOUT** to file. The command also runs the `make programs_nc` and `make programs_gf` targets mentioned below.

### GF & NC Programs

        make programs_nc

and

        make programs_gf

build versions of programs which link directly to device drivers (eliminating the gplt/message queue interface). These are primarily used for projects where multiple scripts are run at scheduled times, as in the cron, and don't require user interaction.

## Troubleshooting

### Missing MOTIF Libraries

Any error messages involving missing Xm files (such as Xm/XmAll.h):

<pre>
> ...include/geminc.h:59:22: Xm/XmAll.h: No such file or directory
> In file included from /home/gempak/GEMPAK7/include/proto.h:28,
>    from /home/gempak/GEMPAK7/include/gemprm.h:647,
</pre>

Indicate that openmotif and openmotif-devel were not found on your system. Either the motif libraries are not installed on your system, or the correct location has not been specified to the compiler. If the latter is the case, you will need to edit **$NAWIPS/config/Makeinc.linux_gfortran** (assuming a linux system using gfortran), where $NA_OS is your system architecture as determined in the Gemenviron configuration file.

### Incorrectly sourced Gemenviron/Gemenviron.profile

The runtime error

<pre>
> [GEMPLT -101]  NOPROC - Nonexistent executable
</pre>

indicates that your environmental variables are not sourced correctly (type command `env` to see all envars and make sure the Gemenviron configuration file is edited and sourced as described above).

### Error in message queue

<pre>
> Error in message send = 22
> itype, ichan, nwords,0,65536,3
</pre>

This runtime error means the message queue is full, which typically occurs when executing GEMPAK programs in batch mode from scripts. To fix, exit GEMPAK and run

        cleanup -c

This command will remove existing message queues (the **ipcrm** command is run to remove message queues found with **ipcs**). It will also look for running **gplt** processes and kill them.
